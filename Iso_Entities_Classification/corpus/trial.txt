Near
the
Puerta
del
Sol

        
Puerta
del
Sol
(
Gateway
to
the
Sun
)
is
Madrid
’s
busiest

        
plaza
and
for
centuries
has
been
the
commercial
hub
of
the
city
.
Today

        
it
marks
the
transition
between
Hapsburg
Madrid
and
the
city
expansion

        
of
the
Bourbon
kings
.
The
original
gate
that
once
existed
here
 
—
 
part

        
of
the
ancient
town
wall
 
—
 
was
torn
down
in
1570
.
Ten
streets
converge

        
on
the
plaza
,
and
all
the
radial
highways
of
Spain
are
measured
from

        
Puerta
del
Sol
,
designated
“
Kilometer
Zero
”
(
on
the
sidewalk
on
the

        
south
side
of
the
square
is
a
symbol
of
this
distinction
)
.

        
The
no
-
nonsense
,
Neo
-
classical
building
on
the
south
side

        
of
the
square
(
Casa
de
Correos
)
houses
the
main
offices
of
the
regional

        
government
.
Thousands
of
Madrileños
gather
here
for
a
ritual
every
New

        
Year
’s
Eve
.
They
try
to
swallow
a
dozen
grapes
while
the
clock
atop
the

        
building
strikes
12
,
after
which
pandemonium
breaks
out
.

        
Facing
all
the
bustle
of
a
remodeled
Puerta
del
Sol
is
a

        
statue
based
on
Madrid
’s
coat
of
arms
,
which
depicts
a
bear
leaning

        
against
a
madroño
tree
(
an
arbutus
,
or
strawberry
tree
)
.
The
bear
is
a

        
symbol
of
Madrid
,
while
the
Tío
Pepe
sign
,
an
advertisement
for
one
of

        
Spain
’s
most
famous
brands
of
sherry
,
has
become
the
unofficial
symbol

        
of
the
Puerta
del
Sol
.

        
Just
north
of
the
Puerta
del
Sol
and
next
door
to
the

        
Ministry
of
Finance
,
is
the
Real
Academia
de
Bellas
Artes
de
San

        
Fernando
 
—
 
call
it
the
Museum
of
the
Royal
Academy
.
It
possesses
a

        
celebrated
collection
of
Goya
’s
paintings
,
including
Burial
of
the

        
Sardine
,
and
a
superb
self
-
portrait
of
the
artist
in
his
old
age
.

        
Velázquez
,
Murillo
,
and
Rubens
are
also
represented
among
the
hundreds

        
of
works
on
display
.
The
Royal
Academy
also
has
a
magnificent

        
collection
of
paintings
by
Zurbarán
,
rivaling
that
of
the
Prado
Museum
.

        
Representative
of
the
artist
’s
austere
,
devotional
style
is
Vision
of

        
the
Blessed
Alonso
Rodríguez
.

        
Southeast
of
Puerta
del
Sol
is
Plaza
Santa
Ana
and
the

        
Huertas
district
,
both
of
which
are
chock
full
of
restaurants
,
tascas

        
and
tapas
bars
,
theaters
,
and
live
music
and
flamenco
clubs
.
The
area

        
really
springs
to
life
at
night
.





04-Sep-2004
--
We
began
our
expedition
on
Saturday
,
September
4th
,
2004
.
At
11
o'clock
we
left
Bucharest
for
Focsani
on
DN
2
(
European
Road
85
)
.
The
GPS
showed
that
we
were
at
185
km
from
the
confluence
North
46
with
East
27
.
We
drove
through
the
cities
of
Urziceni
,
Buzau
,
Ramnicu
Sarat
and
,
after
three
hours
of
driving
and
200
km
,
we
reached
Focsani
,
at
35
km
from
the
confluence
point
,
in
the
county
of
Vrancea



We
continued
our
journey
,
heading
west
,
towards
Panciu
.
Passing
through
the
villages
of
Muncelu
and
Straoane
,
the
distance
to
confluence
point
decreased
to
almost
5
km
.
The
closest
area
of
the
road
to
the
confluence
(
4.8
km
)
is
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Ecaterina
Teodoroiu
monument
(
Romanian
female
hero
of
the
First
World
War
)
.
Because
a
dirtroad
started
right
at
the
monument
(
on
the
right
coming
from
Panciu
)
and
seemed
to
head
exactly
towards
the
target
point
(
direction
North
-
North
-
West
)
,
we
left
the
car
and
continued
our
trip
on
foot
on
the
Dealu
Mare
hill
.



Luckily
,
this
cart
road
kept
us
on
the
right
heading
,
passing
through
the
villagers
'
pastures
,
cornfields
and
vineyards
.
After
about
3
km
,
we
entered
the
forest
,
and
at
a
crossroad
(
1
km
from
the
confluence
)
we
took
the
road
which
kept
us
going
towards
North
-
East
.
As
we
walked
into
the
oak
wood
the
road
changed
into
a
path
,
which
we
left
at
about
300
m
from
the
confluence
because
we
were
getting
away
from
it
.
We
were
surprised
to
meet
a
deer
,
which
wandered
away
quickly
as
it
saw
us
.
We
started
descending
a
slope
towards
North
-
East
-
East
and
,
after
an
hour
of
walking
-
from
the
monument
-
we
reached
our
target
,
deep
into
the
forest
.



Needless
to
say
that
,
because
of
the
treetop
cover
,
we
had
poor
satellite
coverage
,
but
we
managed
to
locate
the
confluence
with
a
10
-
15
m
error
,
after
some
wandering
around
.
It
lays
about
the
western
cliff
of
a
15
m
deep
ravine
,
on
the
bottom
of
which
we
saw
a
dry
riverbed
.
The
steep
slope
and
the
thick
carpet
of
fallen
leaves
hindered
the
descent
and
very
precise
determination
of
the
confluence
point
,
but
we
managed
to
pinpoint
and
take
photos
within
sufficient
accuracy
from
'
zero
point
'
.
We
congratulated
ourselves
and
made
the
necessary
photos
to
immortalize
for
eternity
our
conquest
.



The
return
journey
was
easy
,
because
we
knew
already
the
area
.
By
nightfall
we
were
back
in
Bucharest
.
In
this
region
fierce
battles
took
place
in
the
year
1917
(
Marasti
,
Marasesti
,
Oituz
)
between
the
Romanian
and
Russian
armies
,
on
one
side
and
the
German
and
Austro
-
Hungarian
ones
,
on
the
other
.
Before
starting
our
trek
,
we
visited
the
impressing
mausoleum
at
Marasti
,
at
20
km
of
Panciu
.

Copala
to
Durango
–
4
days
,
163
miles


Thursday
,
January
19th
,
2006

   
I
spent
two
days
in
Copala
,
a
picturesque
town
of
about
1,500
people
in
the
steep
foothills
of
the
Sierra
Madre
Occidente
,
a
massive
mountain
range
that
hugs
the
west
coast
of
Mexico
.
Copala
,
a
former
mining
town
,
now
appears
to
have
an
economy
based
on
tourism
and
livestock
that
make
noise
early
in
the
morning
(
mostly
donkeys
and
chickens
)
.


  
   
In
Copala
I
befriended
a
doctor
and
former
cyclist
who
raced
in
the
1961
-
3
Tour
de
France
,
an
artist
who
spends
one
month
a
year
in
a
vow
of
silence
(
not
this
month
)
,
and
a
young
hotel
manager
who
is
married
to
a
man
more
than
twice
her
age
(
something
that
I
’ve
seen
more
than
once
here
)
.
In
addition
to
companionship
,
these
people
provided
me
with
food
,
medicine
,
highly
discounted
lodging
,
bicycling
advice
,
and
organic
,
herbal
remedies
.


   
Departing
Copala
,
the
road
climbs
to
over
6,000
feet
in
30
miles
,
and
then
continues
to
climb
while
hugging
an
impressive
cliff
-
lined
ridgeline
literally
called
‘
the
spine
of
the
devil
.
’
It
is
the
only
paved
road
through
the
Sierra
Madre
Ocidente
for
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
north
and
south
.
Eventually
,
the
terrain
becomes
less
steep
,
entering
pine
forests
,
but
the
road
continues
to
climb
to
over
9,000
feet
.


  
   
The
second
night
out
of
Copala
,
while
camping
in
the
forest
at
below
freezing
temperatures
,
I
awoke
to
find
a
forest
fire
(
slowly
)
approaching
my
tent
.
I
decided
to
move
camp
.


 
   
The
third
night
out
,
I
stayed
with
the
family
of
the
doctor
’s
mother
-
in
-
law
,
who
lived
in
the
village
of
Llano
Grande
high
in
the
mountains
.
All
employment
in
the
village
is
based
on
harvesting
wood
from
the
forests
.
About
eight
members
of
the
extended
family
shared
a
lot
.
Dinner
was
cooked
on
a
wood
stove
,
and
I
turned
on
and
off
the
light
in
the
extra
room
they
had
by
unscrewing
the
bulb
from
the
socket
.
I
was
the
first
or
second
gringo
that
anyone
in
the
family
had
ever
talked
to
.
(
When
asked
,
they
said
not
to
put
their
photos
on
the
internet
for
the
world
to
see
)
.


 
   
I
am
now
in
the
city
of
Durango
,
staying
for
free
at
a
hotel
because
I
have
befriended
a
man
who
runs
an
excellent
bicycle
touring
company
and
has
connections
to
the
tourism
industry
.
If
you
want
to
do
an
economic
supported
bicycle
tour
near
Durango
,
check
out
their
website
!
Durango
,
with
a
scenic
colonial
downtown
,
sits
at
about
6,000
ft
and
is
filled
with
about
half
a
million
people
.



        
The
Imperial
Palace

        
If
Tokyo
can
be
said
to
have
any
center
at
all
,
this
is
it
.

        
Today
’s
Imperial
Palace
is
on
the
site
of
Edo
castle
,
where
the

        
Tokugawa
shogunate
ruled
Japan
for
265
years
;
it
was
thereafter
home
to

        
the
emperors
of
the
modern
era
.
The
palace
was
almost
totally
destroyed

        
in
the
air
raids
of
World
War
II
,
then
rebuilt
in
ferroconcrete
.
This

        
is
the
least
interesting
part
of
what
was
once
the
largest
system
of

        
fortifications
in
the
world
,
and
in
any
case
you
ca
n’t
get
in
to
see

        
it
.
What
you
can
see
are
the
lovely
grounds
of
the
East
Garden
,
the

        
moat
and
massive
stone
ramparts
,
and
those
few
examples
of
classic

        
Japanese
architecture
 
—
 
gates
,
bridges
,
armories
,
and

        
watchtowers
 
—
 
that
have
survived
since
the
17th
century
.

        
The
imperial
family
still
resides
in
the
palace
,
so
the

        
general
public
is
admitted
to
the
grounds
on
only
two
days
each
year
:

        
on
2
January
and
23
December
.
On
these
occasions
,
you
might
find
it

        
hard
to
compete
with
the
many
thousands
of
Japanese
visitors
who
come

        
to
pay
their
respects
.

        
The
Imperial
Palace
’s
East
Garden
is
open
to
the
public

        
every
day
except
Monday
and
Friday
.
From
Otemachi
subway
station
,
you

        
enter
the
gardens
at
the
Otemon
Gate
and
wander
through
hedgerows
of

        
white
and
pink
azaleas
,
around
ponds
and
little
waterfalls
edged
with

        
pines
,
plum
trees
,
canary
palms
,
and
soft
green
cryptomeria
japonica
.

        
Over
the
treetops
you
catch
an
occasional
glimpse
of
the
skyscrapers
of

        
modern
Tokyo
.
Also
on
the
grounds
are
the
Museum
of
Imperial

        
Collections
,
an
exhibition
hall
for
art
treasures
donated
to
the
public

        
by
the
imperial
family
in
1989
;
and
the
“
Hundred
-
Man
Guardhouse
,
”
where

        
the
approach
to
the
inner
sanctum
of
the
fortress
was
defended
by
four

        
shifts
of
100
samurai
warriors
each
.

        
A
walk
clockwise
around
the
palace
grounds
will
bring
you

        
first
to
the
picturesque
Nijubashi
Bridge
and
the
Seimon
Gate
,
where

        
the
public
is
allowed
to
enter
the
palace
grounds
.
You
then
pass
the

        
most
prominent
of
Japan
’s
modern
government
buildings
,
the
National

        
Diet
(
Japan
’s
parliament
)
and
the
Supreme
Court
.
A
complete
circuit

        
would
also
include
the
National
Theater
,
and
the
National
Museum
of

        
Modern
Art
.
With
a
short
detour
,
you
can
also
take
in
Yasukuni
Jinja
.

        
Founded
in
1869
,
this
is
the
“
Shrine
of
Peace
for
the
Nation
,
”

        
dedicated
to
the
souls
of
those
who
have
died
for
Japan
in
battle
.

        
Besides
the
main
hall
and
the
hall
of
worship
,
the
shrine
complex

        
includes
a
noh
theater
stage
,
a
sumo
wrestling
ring
,
several
teahouses
,

        
and
the
Yushukan
museum
of
war
memorabilia
.
 




23-Jul-2005
--
Well
a
new
job
and
a
new
country
–
or
place
anyway
–
Kosovo
has
an
uncertain
international
status
.
Also
an
uncertain
power
supply
as
I
write
this
by
candle
light
.
Last
Friday
a
colleague
asked
me
if
I
was
going
away
for
the
weekend
–
I
said
I
had
not
planned
anything
–
but
it
set
me
thinking
and
I
quickly
resolved
to
have
a
go
at
the
nearest
incomplete
point
to
Kosovo
–
570
km
as
the
crow
flies
–
850
by
via
-
Michelin
–
in
Romania
.



Fortunately
Eastern
Europe
–
even
outside
the
EU
is
easy
travelling
for
EU
citizens
and
I
was
able
to
jump
in
the
car
(
after
printing
some
multimaps
and
a
visit
report
or
two
(
always
the
optimist
)
and
drive
across
Serbia
,
and
Bulgaria
to
Romania
with
few
hassles
(
those
there
were
concentrated
on
car
insurance
)
.
Leaving
at
3.30
pm
on
Friday
afternoon
I
covered
500
km
on
Fri
eve
and
then
after
sleeping
in
the
car
I
arrived
near
the
confluence
at
around
noon
.



The
instructions
from
the
previous
visitors
were
quite
correct
and
it
was
easy
to
find
the
suggested
start
point
.
I
did
go
a
little
further
up
the
valley
and
came
across
an
explosives
depot
–
I
suppose
It
would
not
have
been
made
welcome
here
a
few
years
ago
in
my
UK
car
!



As
previously
described
the
track
gives
up
after
a
while
and
then
there
is
no
alternative
but
to
follow
the
valley
up
.
The
dry
river
valley
was
no
longer
dry
–
heavy
recent
rains
in
Romania
have
caused
floods
in
several
areas
.
I
tried
to
avoid
walking
in
the
stream
but
the
choice
was
tall
nettles
and
brambles
.
It
soon
became
clear
that
this
point
was
not
going
to
be
taken
easily
and
maybe
the
first
visitors
made
a
wise
choice
not
going
up
.
Adam
Macer
suggested
a
machete
-
good
idea
.



The
valley
is
deep
with
steep
sides
and
my
GPS
would
only
pick
up
3
satellites
–
they
were
in
a
nice
straight
line
and
it
would
not
give
me
a
fix
.
After
a
while
there
was
a
clearing
on
the
east
side
of
the
valley
and
I
decided
to
go
up
here
.
It
was
very
hard
going
–
steep
and
overgrown
.
At
least
it
allowed
the
GPS
to
pick
up
more
satellites
and
confirm
my
position
.
After
a
further
30
minutes
of
climbing
I
eventually
reached
the
point
.
2
hours
for
1.8
km
and
500
metres
ascent
is
slow
going
!



There
was
no
need
to
go
out
of
the
main
valley
and
the
point
was
some
distance
from
the
ridge
line
-
I
did
not
go
on
up
to
the
ridge
to
see
the
rain
from
a
different
angle
!
The
start
altitude
was
550
metres
and
the
estimated
height
for
the
point
on
the
web
site
was
875
metres
.
In
fact
the
point
was
at
1020
metres
–
so
a
climb
of
almost
500
metres
.



The
return
–
as
always
–
was
much
quicker
;
one
hour
only
to
the
car
.
I
stayed
in
deep
forest
as
much
as
possible
on
the
way
to
the
valley
bottom
–
slithering
and
sliding
down
the
deep
leaf
litter
.
Once
at
the
stream
I
abandoned
all
pretence
at
dry
feet
and
splashed
merrily
down
the
stream
–
in
the
rain
.
I
was
soaked
and
had
very
scratched
and
stung
arms
and
legs
but
satisfied
with
the
point
–
stupid
is
n’t
it
!
Near
the
bottom
I
saw
a
black
and
yellow
salamander
trying
to
squeeze
itself
under
a
stone
.
The
next
visitor
is
welcome
to
my
watch
–
it
came
off
somewhere
on
the
way
down
–
if
you
go
at
7.30
am
maybe
you
will
find
it
by
hearing
the
alarm
go
off
.
Anyway
only
a
cheap
Casio
!



After
the
point
I
went
to
Sighişoara
–
home
of
Dracula
with
a
fine
medieval
citadel
.
I
did
n’t
stay
at
the
Dracula
hotel
or
eat
at
the
Dracula
café
but
slept
and
ate
very
well
despite
the
thunderstorm
.
No
time
for
more
points
this
time
–
there
are
two
unvisited
on
the
Moldavian
border
and
one
more
incomplete
near
the
Danube
delta
.
Another
time
.



That
reminds
me
–
I
have
not
seen
the
points
of
Molvania
“
a
land
untouched
by
modern
dentistry
”
on
the
Confluence
Project
web
site
,
I
hope
this
strange
omission
will
be
rectified
so
that
point
baggers
there
can
report
on
their
achievements
.

WHERE
TO
GO

        
In
this
sprawling
city
,
the
parts
of
Madrid
of
greatest

        
interest
to
foreign
visitors
are
remarkably
compact
.
Viejo
Madrid
,
the

        
city
of
the
Hapsburgs
,
covers
a
small
area
that
extends
east
from
the

        
pitiful
Río
Manzanares
and
magnificent
Palacio
Real
to
Puerta
del
Sol
.

        
Almost
all
of
it
can
be
covered
in
a
day
or
two
,
including
a
lengthy

        
visit
to
the
Royal
Palace
.
The
Madrid
of
the
Bourbon
dynasty
,
home
to

        
Spain
’s
great
art
museums
,
is
the
next
area
worthy
of
exploring
(
for

        
art
lovers
,
though
,
it
may
very
well
be
the
first
)
.
Spain
’s
Golden

        
Triangle
of
Art
is
concentrated
on
the
elegant
but
busy
Paseo
del

        
Prado
,
between
Puerta
del
Sol
and
Retiro
Park
.
Those
with
more
time
in

        
Madrid
,
either
before
or
after
side
trips
to
the
great
towns
of

        
Castile
,
might
explore
the
barrio
of
Salamanca
,
take
in
a
bullfight
,
or

        
visit
one
or
more
of
the
smaller
,
more
personal
museums
,
only
a
ride

        
from
the
Puerta
del

--
We
,
eastern
christians
(
orthodox
christians
)
celebrated
Easter
this
year
on
May
5th
.
So
,
on
this
short
holiday
,
we
went
to
Oradea
where
part
of
my
girlfriend
’s
family
lives
.
Oradea
is
600
km
(
about
380
miles
)
from
Bucharest
,
in
the
northwestern
part
of
Romania
,
only
10
km
from
the
border
with
Hungary
.
It
is
a
big
city
(
more
than
220,000
population
)
that
lies
exactly
where
the
hills
end
and
the
Pannonia
Plains
begin
,
on
the
river
Crisul
Repede
(
the
Fast
Cris
)
,
that
crosses
exactly
the
centre
of
the
city
.
Oradea
is
a
medieval
city
,
with
baroque
and
gothic
buildings
,
and
also
with
lots
of
clubs
and
cafes
and
very
nice
people
.
For
some
photos

unfortunately
I
could
n’t

.
Another

would
be

,
which
contains
some
english
text
,
but
few
photos
.
Ok
,
back
to
confluence
hunting
.



On
May
6th
we
decided
to
visit
N47E22
.
We
were
a
pretty
large
group
:
myself
,
my
girlfriend
Andra
,
her
brother
Mihnea
,
their
cousins
from
Oradea
and
a
friend
of
them
.
We
took
road
76
/
E79
to
Deva
,
crossed
the
village
of
Sanmartin
and
turned
left
to
Baile
1
Mai
(
1
Mai
Spa
)
.
Baile
1
Mai
is
known
for
its
hot
-
water
springs
(
lots
of
swimming
-
pools
there
)
.
Same
for
Baile
Felix
(
Felix
Spa
)
nearby
.
In
fact
the
city
of
Oradea
is
heated
with
thermal
water
,
which
is
plenty
around
these
parts
,
you
just
have
to
dig
for
it
.
At
the
sign
that
says
Baile
1
Mai
(
just
half
a
mile
after
turning
left
from
road
76
/
E79
)
we
turned
again
left
and
entered
the
village
of
Rontau
.
We
were
already
in
the
hilly
region
,
so
the
road
climbed
up
to
Rontau
,
which
lies
on
top
of
a
hill
.
While
driving
along
the
village
’s
main
road
the
GPS
showed
us
the
direction
right
ahead
,
and
after
two
minutes
,
just
few
hundred
meters
from
the
end
of
the
village
,
we
reached
the
spot
(
photo
#

)
.



The
confluence
lies
right
on
the
main
road
of
Rontau
,
just
in
front
of
the
pentecostal
church
(
in
fact
the
pentecostal
church
lies
inside
of
a
house
,
probably
the
pentecostal
community
is
n’t
too
large
–

)
.
On
both
sides
there
were
houses
,
backwards
we
could
see
the
road
,
only
in
front
of
us
another
forested
hill
could
be
seen
,
as
the
main
road
climbes
down
the
hill
,
exiting
the
village
.
The
elevation
was
179
meters
.



You
can
see
the
view
eastwards
in
the
main
picture
(

)
.
The
road
exits
Rontau
and
climbs
down
the
hill
,
so
we
could
see
another
hill
.
Down
in
the
valley
you
can
see
some
buildings
from
Baile
1
Mai
.

Next
day
we
left

07-May-2002
--
English
On
our
way
home
from
Oradea
(
see
N47E22
)
we
made
a
detour
for
N47E23
.
In
Ciucea
,
after
visiting
the
Goga
memorial
house
(
a
poet
and
former
prime
-
minister
from
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
–
worthy
of
a
visit
,
takes
less
than
an
hour
)
we
exited
Road1
/
E60
and
turned
left
to
Romanasi
.
The
road
was
crossing
the
small
mountains
of
Salaj
County
,
a
region
with
lots
of
mountains
and
hills
,
lying
in
the
northern
part
of
the
Western
Carpathians
,
where
the
mountains
lose
height
and
become
hills
.
We
crossed
many
villages
,
but
the
confluence
approached
by
a
very
small
rate
:
while
we
were
driving
one
kilometer
the
confluence
approached
by
half
a
kilometer
.
At
some
point
we
thought
that
we
had
taken
perhaps
not
the
best
road
to
get
near
the
spot
.
But
we
decided
to
keep
driving
,
and
after
some
20
km
from
Ciucea
,
in
the
village
of
Bogdana
,
we
turned
right
,
just
near
the
main
village
church
.
The
confluence
seemed
to
be
over
a
hill
.
So
we
drove
along
a
small
river
that
took
us
just
by
that
hill
.
After
exiting
Bogdana
the
road
is
so
bad
that
an
off
-
road
vehicle
is
a
must
.
We
drove
for
another
2
or
3
km
when
the
GPS
showed
the
confluence
directly
up
the
hill
,
500
m
further
.
We
left
the
car
under
some
trees
,
for
shade
,
and
started
climbing
.



The
climb
was
a
pleasure
:
few
trees
,
the
terrain
being
mainly
pasture
,
with
lots
of
field
flowers
and
a
warming
sun
.
No
animals
or
humans
at
all
.
Just
the
sound
of
insects
and
birds
.
All
around
us
we
could
see
only
forested
heights
,
except
for
some
houses
from
Bogdana
and
the
farming
fields
around
the
village
.
We
reached
the
spot
in
about
10
minutes
.
The
elevation
was
536
m.
We
were
just
100
m
away
from
the
top
of
the
hill
,
from
where
I
could
have
taken
pictures
for
a
beautiful
360
degree
panorama
.

view
northwards
,
towards
Bogdana
(
which
can
not
be
seen
because
of
the
hill
)
.
On
the
horizon
the
Meses
Mountains
can
be
seen
.
The
center
of
the
panorama
shows
the
way
we
climbed
to
the
confluence
.

taken
southwards
.
For
many
miles
in
that
direction
there
are
no
human
settlements
,
only
forests
and
hills
.
Pic

taken
northwards
.
Pic
#

shows
the
way
we
climbed
to
the
spot
.
In
front
of
the
near
forest
you
can
see
a
pole
:
that
’s
used
for
hay
stacks
,
but
now
being
spring
the
hay
was
recently
exhausted
.
At
summer
’s
end
farmers
will
again
gather
grass
and
pile
it
around
that
pole
.
This
kind
of
poles
were
everywhere
on
those
pastures
(
in
fact
poles
like
that
can
be
seen
on
every
pasture
in
Romania
)
.

is
taken
on
our
way
back
to
the
main
road
:
you
can
see
the
condition
of
the
road
that
we
used
to
approach
the
confluence
,
some
houses
in
Bogdana
and
some
horses
,
right
on
the
road
.
Pic
#

shows
the
main
church
of
Bogdana
.
This
is
the
point
where
the
road
to
the
confluence
reaches
the
main
road
Ciucea
–
Romanasi
.
If
you
look
through
the
trees
,
along
the
dirt
road
,
you
can
see
that
it
climbs
a
slight
slope
.
At
the
end
of
the
slope
it
’s
the
intersection
.
If
you
come
from
Ciucea
you
turn
right
when
you
see
that
church
on
your
left
.
In
this
picture
notice
also
a
small
bridge
,
over
the
main
river
of
the
area
,
Agrij
,
that
flows
just
between
the
houses
.



Getting
back
to
the
paved
road
we
decided
not
to
go
back
to
Ciucea
but
to
go
on
to
Romanasi
,
where
we
met
Road
1F
/
E81
.
We
had
only
70
more
km
to
Cluj
(
the
next
important
city
on
our
way
back
to
Bucharest
)
taking
this
way
,
while
if
getting
back
to
Ciucea
and
on
to
Cluj
the
normal
way
would
have
been
now
about
25
km
longer
.
So
it
was
a
pretty
long
detour
but
worthy
,
as
we
mapped
the
13th
Romanian
confluence
.



﻿http://confluence.org
/
confluence.php?id=9806





26-Dec-2002
--
This
confluence
can
be
found
1,5
km
to
the
west
from
Icafalâu
(
Ikafalva
)
in
Covasna
county
,
Romania
.
It
is
interesting
to
know
,
that
this
county
was
the
easternmost
corner
of
Hungary
until
the
end
of
the
WWI
.
The
ancient
name
of
the
county
is
Háromszék
and
Ikafalva
(
Icafalău
)
is
one
of
its
oldest
villages
.
The
county
is
part
of
Transylvania
,
and
is
mainly
inhabited
by
Székely
people
(
Hungarian
people
living
in
Eastern
Transylvania
)
–
they
speak
Hungarian
up
to
the
present
days
.
Today
this
land
is
300
km
far
from
the
Hungarian
state
border
,
deeply
in
the
heart
of
Romania
.



We
have
spent
the
Christmas
time
at
Judit
’s
parents
in
Sfântu
Gheorghe
(
Sepsiszentgyörgy
)
,
capital
of
Covasna
.
We
had
white
Christmas
there
and
15
-
20
degree
Celsius
below
zero
.
On
26th
of
December
the
four
of
us
-
me
,
my
wife
Judit
,
her
father
Apja
and
her
friend
Andrea
-
went
for
discovering
this
confluence
in
the
Bodok
mountains
,
only
23
km
apart
from
Sepsiszentgyörgy
.
The
sun
was
shining
and
the
snow
was
crunching
in
the
numbing
cold
.
Perfect
time
for
the
conquest
.
We
drove
to
the
NE
on
the
11
main
road
and
turned
NW
at
Cernat
(
Csernáton
)
.
From
this
point
we
had
to
drive
through
the
village
and
than
towards
North
on
a
narrow
mountain
road
,
where
the
horse
-
sleigh
is
so
far
the
most
popular
winter
vehicle
.
We
parked
the
car
in
a
small
field
where
we
could
turn
.
This
was
only
250
meters
from
the
confluence
!
After
a
short
discussion
and
a
few
cups
of
hot
tea
we
walked
towards
the
target
that
seemed
to
be
located
on
the
hill
.
This
area
is
a
valley
of
a
small
creek
.
After
a
short
tracking
we
realized
that
there
was
no
path
up
to
the
peak
except
for
some
animal
trails
.
We
chose
the
shortest
way
to
the
top
in
the
deep
snow
.
After
about
one
hundred
meters
of
elevation
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
saddle
,
very
close
to
the
intersection
of
46
°
N
and
26
°
E.
The
confluence
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
.
Fortunately
we
had
good
satellite
signal
because
of
the
winter
.
I
have
an
old
Garmin
but
I
got
an
accurate
position
.
(
picture
#
5
)
It
is
725
meter
above
sea
level
.
I
took
photos
to
the
four
winds
(
picture
#
1
-
4
)
and
from
the
team
also
.
(
picture
#

)



There
was
only
1
PM
(
local
time
)
so
we
had
some
time
left
to
discover
an
interesting
ruin
of
Ikavár
(
Ika
castle
)
.
The
castle
is
1
km
to
SW
on
the
other
side
of

the

There
was

Where
to
Go

        
To
help
you
plan
your
itinerary
,
we
divide
Japan
into
seven

        
regional
sections
.
The
first
is
devoted
entirely
to
Tokyo
,
where
you
’re

        
likely
to
begin
your
trip
,
get
your
bearings
,
and
become
acquainted

        
with
modern
Japan
.
We
then
present
six
tours
spreading
out
from
the

        
capital
to
the
centers
of
historic
and
artistic
interest
as
well
as
to

        
sites
of
natural
beauty
.
If
you
have
sufficient
time
to
explore
Japan
,

        
you
might
want
to
begin
and
end
your
visit
in
Tokyo
.
In
between
,
you

        
can
venture
out
to
explore
the
rest
of
the
country
.

Tokyo

        
Originally
known
as
Edo
(
meaning
“
estuary
”
)
,
Tokyo
was
just

        
a
sleepy
little
village
surrounded
by
marshland
on
the
broad
Kanto

        
plain
until
the
end
of
the
16th
century
,
when
Tokugawa
Ieyasu
moved

        
here
and
made
it
the
center
of
his
vast
domains
.
When
Ieyasu
became

        
shogun
in
1603
,
Edo
in
turn
became
the
seat
of
national

        
government
 
—
 
and
its
castle
the
largest
in
the
world
.
Edo
expanded

        
rapidly
to
accommodate
Ieyasu
’s
80,000
retainers
and
their
families
and

        
the
myriad
common
people
who
served
their
daily
needs
.
By
1787
the

        
population
had
grown
to
1,368,000
.

        
The
ruling
elite
lived
on
the
high
ground
,
the
Yamanote

        
(
“
bluffs
”
)
west
and
south
of
the
castle
.
The
artisans
,
tradespeople
,

        
and
providers
of
entertainment
(
reputable
and
not
so
reputable
)
lived

        
“
downtown
”
on
the
reclaimed
marshlands
north
and
east
,
in
the
area

        
still
known
as
Shitamachi
.
As
these
two
populations
interacted
,
a

        
unique
new
culture
was
born
.
Edo
became
the
center
of
power
and
also

        
the
center
of
all
that
was
vibrant
and
compelling
in
the
arts
.

        
After
1868
that
center
grew
even
stronger
,
when
the
movement

        
known
as
the
Meiji
Restoration
overthrew
the
Tokugawa
shogunate
and
the

        
imperial
court
moved
to
Edo
.
The
city
was
renamed
Tokyo
(
“
Eastern

        
Capital
”
)
,
and
from
that
moment
on
all
roads
 
—
 
political
,
cultural
,
and

        
financial
 
—
 
led
here
.

        
In
the
20th
century
Tokyo
has
twice
suffered
almost
total

        
destruction
.
First
,
the
earthquake
of
1923
and
subsequent
fire
razed

        
nearly
all
vestiges
of
old
Edo
,
killing
some
140,000
people
in
the

        
process
.
Rebuilt
without
any
comprehensive
urban
plan
,
Tokyo
remains
a

        
city
of
subcenters
and
neighborhoods
,
even
villages
,
each
with
its
own

        
distinct
personality
.

        
Unlike
the
great
capital
cities
of
Europe
,
there
is
no

        
prevailing
style
of
architecture
here
,
no
“
monumental
”
core
for
a
new

        
building
to
harmonize
or
clash
with
.
Even
after
the
collapse
of
the

        
economic
bubble
in
1992
,
construction
projects
are
everywhere
.
Whole

        
blocks
of
the
city
seem
to
disappear
overnight
,
replaced
in
the
blink

        
of
an
eye
by
new
office
buildings
,
condominiums
,
cultural
complexes
,

        
and
shopping
centers
.

        
Tokyo
is
a
city
of
enormous
creative
and
entrepreneurial

        
energy
,
much
of
which
goes
into
reinventing
itself
.
If
there
’s
a

        
commodity
in
short
supply
here
,
it
’s
relaxation
.
Nobody
“
strolls
”
in

        
Tokyo
,
and
there
are
few
places
to
sit
down
outdoors
and
watch
the

        
world
go
by
.
The
idea
of
a
long
,
leisurely
lunch
hour
is
utterly
alien
.

        
People
in
Tokyo
are
in
a
hurry
to
get
somewhere
 
—
 
even
if
they
do
n’t

        
always
know
precisely
where
they
’re
going
.

09-Aug-2003
--
On
Saturday
,
9th
August
2003
,
Daniel
and
I
start
with
our
Enduros
approx
.
100
kilometers
from
the
confluence
point
.
In
the
preceding
years
I
travelled
some
thousand
offroad
kilometers
in
Romania
and
therefore
we
take
the
most
beautiful
Enduro
paths
to
the
confluence
point
,
naturally
there
is
also
something
new
to
discover
.



The
last
kilometers
before
we
take
the
forest
road
,
which
leads
approximately
toward
the
confluence
point
,
we
are
driving
on
the
street
,
because
it
goes
steeply
uphill
from
the
valley
and
is
is
rather
hard
to
drive
in
the
forest
.
I
drove
through
this
road
section
already
several
times
,
conscious
that
it
is
very
near
to
the
confluence
point
N
45
°
E
22
°
(
for
the
first
time
in
August
1999
)
,
however
without
knowing
of
the
"
Degree
Confluence
Project
"
-
my
friend
Ulrich
Leardi
told
me
of
it
.



We
bend
off
on
the
forest
road
,
which
is
partly
freshly
graded
.
In
the
top
there
are
even
completely
new
branches
toward
to
the
confluence
point
because
of
the
present
timber
work
!
We
try
to
drive
near
on
the
wood
-
cutting
tracks
as
close
as
possible
,
and
after
approx
.
2
hours
of
travel
we
got
the
motorcycles
to
within
530
meters
of
the
confluence
point
.
We
cross
a
light
hardwood
forest
and
a
deeply
cut
brook
bed
.
In
our
maps
the
confluence
point
would
have
to
lie
on
a
clearing
.
At
the
top
the
forest
becomes
lighter
,
we
goe
toward
it
and
discover
a
clearing
,
grown
mainly
with
large
ferns
,
the
confluence
point
is
however
still
approx
..
100
meters
further
southwest
.
We
dive
again
into
the
hardwood
forest
and
cross
a
further
,
deeply
cut
brook
bed
.



The
confluence
point
is
now
a
few
steps
from
here
,
and
we
move
in
a
zigzag
through
the
forest
,
the
arrow
on
the
GPS
jumping
again
and
again
around
.
After
several
attempts
,
however
,
we
always
land
in
the
same
place
:
Here
is
the
confluence
point
!



We
take
a
few
pictures
,
unfortunately
without
the
hoped
-
for
view
and
take
a
small
rest
.
Then
we
take
the
way
back
through
the
wonderful
landscape
,
having
afterwards
a
very
interesting
Enduro
week
with
many
beautiful
Offroad
kilometers
.



Romania
has
very
much
nature
to
offer
,
the
hospitality
of
the
people
is
terrific
-
this
country
is
always
worth
a
journey
!

The
Rising
Oceans


Friday
,
March
16th
,
2007

   
I
am
sitting
in
an
internet
cafe
in
Punta
Arenas
,
Chile
,
right
now
,
doing
web
searches
to
figure
out
just
how
big
of
a
problem
sea
level
rise
will
be
.
The
sea
level
has
already
risen
over
the
past
century
,
although
only
about
one
inch
.
As
more
glacial
ice
melts
,
what
will
it
do
from
here
on
?


  
   
The
most
likely
result
is
not
that
bad
–
maybe
a
foot
and
a
half
this
century
.
This
could
be
very
bad
for
many
places
I
have
visited
â€
“
especially
along
the
Caribbean
coastâ€”and
also
make
storms
much
worse
,
not
to
mention
erode
some
nice
beaches
.
But
I
might
not
call
it
a
disaster
.


  
 
   
The
problem
,
though
,
is
that
it
takes
a
long
time
for
ice
sheets
to
melt
,
and
we
donâ€
™
t
really
know
how
long
that
is
.
In
the
â€˜long
run
,
â€
™
which
could
be
centuries
or
millennium
,
with
a
likely
3
degree
C
warming
,
the
ocean
could
rise
80
feet
.
We
donâ€
™
t
know
if
it
is
centuries
or
millennium
,
because
computer
models
for
ice
sheets
are
very
inaccurate
.
If
it
is
centuries
,
as
some
argue
,
the
oceans
could
rise
much
faster
than
we
would
like
–
maybe
a
foot
a
decade
.
And
,
again
,
we
donâ€
™
t
know
,
but
,
well
,
do
we
want
to
find
out
?


  
   
As
I
have
said
before
,
I
am
in
Punta
Arenas
right
now
.
Punta
Arenas
sits
on
the
shore
of
the
Straight
of
Magellan
on
the
southern
tip
of
South
America
,
and
is
just
one
of
the
many
cities
on
the
coast
that
I
have
visited
.
Throughout
this
entry
I
have
interspersed
photos
of
the
coastlines
I
have
visited
on
this
trip
–
take
a
look
at
them
and
envision
what
a
1
foot
,
10
foot
,
or
80
foot
sea
level
rise
would
look
like
.




        
Bourbon
Madrid

        
West
of
Puerta
del
Sol
is
the
city
’s
18th
-
century
expansion

        
engineered
by
the
Bourbon
monarchs
.
Calle
de
Alcalá
merges
with
Gran

        
Vía
and
leads
to
the
Plaza
de
la
Cibeles
and
the
Paseo
del
Prado
,
with

        
its
trio
of
art
museums
.
The
area
’s
spacious
boulevards
,
grand
plazas
,

        
and
fountains
are
interspersed
with
densely
populated
18th
-
century

        
apartment
buildings
.
After
hitting
the
art
world
’s
Big
Three
,
visitors

        
can
repair
to
Retiro
Park
,
where
kings
once
found
respite
from
the

        
demands
of
hectic
city
life
.

        
Except
for
the
traffic
spitting
out
noise
and
air

        
pollution
,
the
ample
Plaza
de
la
Cibeles
is
splendid
.
The
central

        
fountain
depicts
Cybele
,
a
controversial
Greek
fertility
goddess
,

        
serenely
settled
in
a
chariot
pulled
by
two
lions
.
The
sculptural

        
ensemble
is
probably
the
best
-
known
fountain
in
all
Spain
.
The
most

        
unavoidable
building
on
the
plaza
is
the
cathedral
-
like
Palacio
de

        
Comunicaciones
,
teasingly
nicknamed
Nuestra
Señora
de
las

        
Comunicaciones
(
Our
Lady
of
Communications
)
.
Inaugurated
in
1919
,
the

        
building
is
the
quite
remarkable
central
post
office
,
with
high

        
ceilings
and
overhead
walkways
.

        
Also
facing
Plaza
de
la
Cibeles
,
the
Banco
de
España
(
Bank

        
of
Spain
)
headquarters
combines
Neo
-
classical
,
Baroque
,
and
rococo

        
styles
.
The
financial
district
,
Madrid
’s
Wall
Street
,
begins
here
on

        
calle
de
Alcalá
.
Imposing
buildings
in
this
high
-
rent
district
contain

        
the
head
offices
or
branches
of
more
than
100
banks
,
plus
insurance

        
companies
,
the
finance
ministry
,
and
on
nearby
Plaza
de
la
Lealtad
,
the

        
Bolsa
de
Comercio
(
Stock
E
xchange
)
.
Heading
down
leafy
Paseo
del
Prado

        
you
’ll
find
the
first
,
and
greatest
,
of
the
art
museums
here
.
