We SPATIAL_ENTITY

 O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY

The O
ground SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
rich O
in O
organic O
matter SPATIAL_ENTITY

and O
thus O
serves O
as O
a O
huge O
sponge SPATIAL_ENTITY

which O
stores O
water SPATIAL_ENTITY

cleans O
it SPATIAL_ENTITY

releases MOTION

You O

    O
Over O
the O
past O
few O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O

, O
the O
earth O
has O
oscillated O
between O

warm O
periods O

such O
as O
we O
have O
today O

known O
as O
interglacial O
periods O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
research O
, O
during O
the O
ice O
ages O
, O
the O
paramo O
grasslands PLACE
could O
be O
found O
further O
down SPATIAL_SIGNAL

, O
covering SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
far O
larger O
area PLACE
. O

During O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
today O
, O
the O
paramo PLACE
is O
restricted SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to O
the O
mountaintops PLACE
, O
literally O
islands PLACE
of O
grassland O
in SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Andes PATH
. O

    O
Climate O
change O
this O
century O
will O
likely O
push O
the O
planet O
far O
warmer O
than O
it O
has O
seen O
during O
these O
past O
glacial O
and O
interglacial O
cycles O
, O
and O
the O
paramo PLACE
will O
have O
to O
move MOTION
further O
up MOTION_SIGNAL
the O
mountainsides PATH

But O
the O
ecosystem SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
already O
at SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountaintops PLACE
, O
with O
nowhere O
to O
go O
, O
and O
the O
region O
is O
at O
risk O
. O

A O
drastically O
warmer O
earth O
might O
remove O
the O
paramo O
ecosystem SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
removing O
not O
only O
the O
valuable O
water O
storage O
and O
filtering O
it O
provides O

also O
losing O
many O

    O
Before O

we SPATIAL_ENTITY
ran MOTION

Not O

in O
competition O
( O
you O
can O
watch O
the O
video O
on O
the O
right O
to O
understand O
this O
) O
. O

But O
the O
ciclorutas PATH
are O
nonetheless O
incredibly O
successful O
, O
showing O
that O
with O
more O
investment O
, O
even O
more O
is O
possible O
. O

    O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
spent NONMOTION_EVENT
my O
last O
day O
in SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city PLACE
enjoying O
the O
ciclovia O
, O
an O
event O
every O
Sunday O
where O
many O
roads O
are O
closed O
to O
cars O
and O
open O
only O
for O
bicycles O
. O

Apparently O
, O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
it O
on O
a O
low O
turnout O
day O
( O
blame O
the O
world O
cup O
– O
Brazil PLACE
was O
playing O
) O
, O
but O
the O
roads PATH
were O
still O
filled SPATIAL_SIGNAL
with O
bicycles SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
people SPATIAL_ENTITY
out O
to O
enjoy O
themselves O
. O

( O
The O
clowns O
on O
the O
right O
are O
in O
charge O
of O
making O
fun O
of O
people O
without O
helmets O
. O

) O
    O
The O
new O
Bogota PLACE
has O
another O
benefit O
as O
well O
â€ O
“ O
people SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
traveling MOTION
more O
efficiently O
, O
using O
fewer O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

Indeed O
, O
redesigning O
Bogota PLACE
around O
people O
and O
bicycles O
has O
not O
only O
improved O
the O
safety O
, O
health O
, O
and O
pride O
of O
its O
citizens O
, O
but O
the O
city O
has O
also O
reduced O
its O
effect O
on O
the O
global O
environment O
. O

This O
is O
a O
win O
- O
win O
situation O
â€ O
“ O
better O
city O
living O
and O
less O
carbon O
dioxide O
emissions O
. O

Hopefully O
, O
more O
cities O
in O
the O
world O
can O
follow O
Bogotaâ€ O

that O
was O
once O
one O
of O
the O

The O

around O

when O

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
met MOTION

a O
group SPATIAL_ENTITY

researchers O
who O
are O
drilling NONMOTION_EVENT
into O
the O
lake O

bottom SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
attempting O
to O
determine O
the O
past O

the O

By O
looking O
at O
the O
composition O
of O
layers O

on SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
lake O

bottom PLACE
, O
the O
scientists O
can O
determine O

, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
type O
of O
vegetation SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
surrounded SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
lake PLACE
. O

     O
According O
to O
their O
research O
, O
around O
900AD O
, O
when O
the O
Mayan O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
a O
series O
of O
intense O
droughts O
struck O
the O
region O
, O
likely O
making O
it O
difficult O
for O
the O
Mayans O
to O
feed O
their O
large O
cities O
. O

The O
lake O
sediments O
also O
suggest O
major O
deforestation O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
a O
combination O
of O
drought O
and O
land O
degradation O
led O
the O
Mayans SPATIAL_ENTITY
to O
abandon MOTION
their O
settlements PLACE
. O

We O
can O
not O
be O
sure O
of O
how O
the O
Mayan O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
but O
it O
now O
seems O
that O
climate O
change O
helped O
end O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
ancient O
civilizations O

the O

Peru O

it O
almost O
never O

â€ O
“ O
my O
tour O
guide O
for O
an O
exhibit NONMOTION_EVENT

Lima PLACE
told O
me SPATIAL_ENTITY
that O
the O
last O
time O
there O
was O
heavy O
rain O
was O
35 O
years O
ago O
. O

    O
All O
of O
the O
water SPATIAL_ENTITY
for MOTION_SIGNAL
the O
city PLACE
comes MOTION
from MOTION_SIGNAL
the O
mountains PLACE
, O
where SPATIAL_SIGNAL
it SPATIAL_ENTITY
falls MOTION
as O
rain O
or O
snow O
and O
then O
melts NONMOTION_EVENT
, O
filling MOTION
the O
rivers PATH
. O

During O
the O
dry O
season O
, O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
water O
is O
from O
melting O
snow O
and O
ice O
. O

Unfortuantely O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
these O
glaciers O
are O
going O
to O
melt O
and O
dissapear O
in O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
. O

It O
is O
unclear O
where O
Peruvians O
will O
get O
their O
water O
from O
when O
the O
glaciers O
are O
gone O
. O

    O
The O

at O

According O
to O
people O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
talked O
to O

PROCLIM O

a O

the O

, O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
water SPATIAL_ENTITY
in SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O

is O
from O
glacial O
runoff O

Unless O
investment O

Peru PLACE

we O
all O

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
thought O
that O

Before O

one O

would O
be O
‘ O

by O
the O

then O
he O
added O
something O
that O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O

understand O

acted O
out O
some O
type O
of O
animal O
with O
large O
claws O
attacking O
me SPATIAL_ENTITY

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
ready O
to O
dismiss O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
, O
but O
then O
he O
said O
‘ O

, O
this O
woman O
had O
her O
husband O
killed O

eaten O
by O
the O
natives O

confirmed O

the O
Confluence O

was O
situated O
only O
a O
few O
kilometres O
away O
from O
the O

. O

Such O
an O
opportunity O

be O
taken O
. O

 O
The O
GPS O
routed O
us O
through O
the O
village O
‘ O
Rot O
an O

Rot O
’ O
. O

In O
a O
very O
friendly O
atmosphere O
we O
saw O
an O
affectionately O
restored O
monastery O
building O
. O

Furthermore O
the O
trip O
lead O
us O
into O
the O
village O
of O
Spindelwag O
. O

Woodwork O
seems O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
here O
. O

 O
On O
the O
one O
hand O
I O
never O
saw O
more O
palettes O
on O
a O
heap O
before O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
a O
big O
wooden O
hull O
was O
produced O
over O
the O
street O
. O

After O
about O
1,000 O
meters O
we O
reached O
the O
confluence O
point O
on O
a O
court O
from O
a O
homestead O
. O

 O
In O
these O
late O
hours O
I O
did O
n't O
wanted O
to O
disturb O
anybody O
, O
so O
I O
did O
my O
short O
confluence O
dance O
without O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
owners O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
noises O
of O
the O
live O
stock O
in O
the O
stable O
I O
could O
n't O
hear O
anything O
or O
see O
anybody O
. O

Despite O
the O
darkness O
the O
needed O
pictures O
turned O
out O
quite O
well O
. O

The O
GPS O
reception O
was O
very O
good O
and O

 O
After O
an O
easy O
entry O
to O
Romania O
we O
visited O
the O
church O
of O
Pătrăuţi O
. O

There O
we O
met O
the O
priest O
, O
who O
was O
building O
a O
new O
wooden O
church O
to O
prevent O
the O
old O
one O
from O
damage O
. O

He O
gave O
us O
an O
very O
interesting O
guide O
of O
the O
church O
's O
history O
. O

It O
is O
painted O
outside O
at O
one O
wall O
and O
also O
inside O
it O
is O
completely O
painted O
. O

 O
Then O
passing O
Suceava O
and O
Botoşani O
we O
headed O
to O
Săveni O
, O
where O
we O
took O
road O
29 O
towards O
Manoleasa O
. O

This O
road O
brought O
us O
to O
a O
distance O
of O
410 O
m O
to O
48N O
27E O
, O
so O
it O
is O
not O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
the O
point O
! O

We O
parked O
our O
car O
beside O
the O
hardly O
used O
street O
. O

Only O
some O
horse O
- O
drawn O
trolleys O
with O
hay O
came O
along O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

So O
we O
entered O
a O
huge O
field O
- O
area O
again O
and O
walked O
around O
a O
corn O
- O
field O
and O
through O
a O
sunflower O
- O
field O
to O
a O
meadow O
, O
where O
we O
easily O
could O
locate O
the O
CP O
. O

Back O
at O
the O
car O
we O
headed O
on O
to O
Iaşi O
and O
on O
the O
way O
along O
the O
river O
Prut O
we O
were O
able O
to O
see O

The O
initial O
plan O
was O
to O
meet O
up O
with O
my O
brother O
and O
sister O
who O
were O
over O
from O
blighty O
visiting O
some O
relations O
in O
Ingolstadt O
that O
we O
had O
n't O
seen O
in O
along O
time O
. O

Instead O
of O
rushing O
there O
, O
visiting O
some O
people O
, O
and O
rushing O
back O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
leave O
early O
and O
visit O
CP O
48N O
12E O
on O
the O
way O
. O

 O
We O
left O
Salzburg O
at O
around O
11 O
a.m. O
driving O
along O
the O
A8 O
( O
main O
Salzburg O
- O
Munich O
Autobahn O
) O
, O
via O
Rosenheim O
to O
Aßling O
and O
then O
towards O
Ebersberg O
before O
turning O
off O
down O
the O
road O
that O
took O
us O
to O
the O
CP O
. O

We O
stopped O
before O
the O
bridge O
over O
the O
stream O
. O

The O
CP O
was O
located O
a O
few O
metres O
into O
the O
adjacent O
field O
. O

 O
I O
had O
hoped O
the O
ground O
would O
be O
frozen O
so O
I O
could O
walk O
into O
the O
field O
with O
my O
normal O
shoes O
, O
take O
the O
necessary O
photos O
, O
and O
clear O
off O
. O

The O
weather O
had O
been O
quite O
cold O
a O
few O
days O
before O
but O
now O
we O
were O
experiencing O
a O
warm O
period O
( O
6 O
degrees O
centigrade O
and O
beautiful O
sunshine O
) O
and O
the O
field O
was O
muddy O
, O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

So O
it O
was O
on O
with O
my O
walking O
boots O
( O
I O
was O
never O
a O
scout O
but O
I O
am O
always O
prepared O
- O
some O
of O
my O
friends O
would O
disagree O
) O
and O
into O
the O
field O
. O

 O
Luckily O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
do O
any O
dancing O
( O
have O
you O
ever O
danced O
in O
mud O
? O

) O
as O
the O
zeroes O
came O
up O
immediately O
and O
stayed O
there O
. O

The O
differential O
GPS O
assisted O
accuracy O
showed O
2 O
metres O
. O

 O
We O
took O
a O
short O
walk O
to O
the O
infamous O
SPD O
meridian O
stone O
and O
up O
to O
the O
bridge O
, O
took O
some O
more O
photos O
and O
decided O
to O
head O
for O
Ingolstadt O
. O

We O
were O
behind O
schedule O
again O
but O
that O
did O
n't O
matter O
- O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
sunny O
day O
and O
we O
'd O
just O
successfully O
visited O
a O

I O
convinced O
the O
family O
to O
visit O
this O
beautiful O

. O

After O
having O
left O
the O
highway O
, O
it´s O
only O
a O
short O
trip O
through O
Augsburg O
and O
some O
smaller O
villages O
to O
come O
to O
this O
point O
. O

 O
We O
drove O
some O
small O
roads O
along O
nice O
Bavarian O
meadows O
and O
stopped O
about O
500 O
m O
away O
from O
the O
confluence O
. O

From O
here O
we O
had O
a O
wonderful O
view O
on O
the O
Alps O
while O
dancing O
towards O
the O
desired O
zeros O

 O
After O
taking O

This O
is O
the O
second O
out O
of O
two O
confluence O
points O
that O
I O
visited O
on O
a O
bicycle O
trip O
from O
Zurich O
into O
the O
Vosges O
Mountains O
and O
the O
Black O
Forest O
. O

The O
story O
starts O
from O
48 O
° O
N O
7 O
° O
E. O
 O
On O
confluence O
day O
, O
I O
started O
cycling O
at O
5:30 O
a.m. O
in O
the O
village O
Midlach O
in O
the O
Vosges O
Mountains O
. O

I O
came O
through O
the O
city O
of O
Colmar O
and O
entered O
Germany O
at O
the O
border O
town O
Brisach O
. O

At O
noon O
time O
, O
I O
reached O
Freiburg O
– O
a O
city O
that O
is O
located O
10 O
km O
west O
of O
the O
confluence O
. O

 O
From O
Freiburg O
, O
a O
nice O
bike O
- O
path O
along O
the O
Dreisam O
creek O
leads O
to O
the O
village O
Stegen O
( O
4 O
km O
from O
CP O
) O
. O

From O
here O
, O
a O
narrow O
valley O
of O
the O
Eschbach O
stream O
follows O
upwards O
to O
the O
confluence O
. O

At O
a O
small O
village O
called O
Obertal O
( O
510 O
m O
from O
CP O
) O
I O
left O
the O
main O
road O
and O
searched O
for O
some O
tracks O
that O
would O
lead O
upwards O
to O
the O
confluence O
point O
. O

My O
approach O
was O
quite O
complicated O
; O
I O
detoured O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill O
to O
a O
place O
with O
a O
wayside O
cross O
and O
some O
nice O
benches O
. O

From O
this O
viewpoint O
( O
300 O
m O
from O
CP O
) O
I O
could O
see O
the O
highest O
peak O
of O
the O
snow O
covered O
Feldberg O
( O
1494 O
m O
) O
. O

 O
I O
parked O
my O
bicycle O
and O
continued O
on O
foot O
by O
climbing O
down O
a O
steep O
grade O
directly O
towards O
the O
confluence O
point O
– O
passing O
by O
some O
grazing O
cows O
. O

Straight O
away O
I O
could O
see O
the O
unique O
marker O
of O
the O
point O
: O
a O
green O
sail O
from O
a O
windsurfing O
board O
with O
the O
inscription O
“ O

which O
means O
‘ O
On O
18th O
July O
2007 O
Here O
has O
been O
the O
fourth O
grade O
elementary O
school O
Stegen O
- O
Eschbach O
. O

Confluence O
- O
Point O
’ O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
consider O
such O
markers O
as O
pollution O
, O
I O
followed O
the O
slogan O
of O
the O
Confluence O
Project O
which O
says O
“ O
take O
nothing O
but O
pictures O
, O
leave O
nothing O
but O
footprints O
” O
. O

So O
I O
kept O
the O
sail O
as O
it O
was O
. O

 O
Getting O
a O
perfect O
zero O
reading O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
lengthy O
back O
and O
forth O
– O
which O
is O
normally O
the O
case O
at O
densely O
forested O
steep O
grades O
. O

With O
4 O
m O
accuracy O
, O
I O
finally O
located O
the O
confluence O
about O
6 O
m O
west O
of O
the O
sail O
directly O
at O
the O
track O
. O

When O
I O
took O
the O
picture O
of O
the O
GPS O
, O
the O
accuracy O
turned O
to O
5 O
m O
again O
. O

 O
Let O
me O
here O
consider O
an O
interesting O
geographical O
feature O
: O
The O
Vosges O
Mountains O
and O
the O
Black O
Forest O
are O
two O
related O
mountain O
ranges O
with O
similar O
heights O
( O
1424 O
m O
and O
1494 O
m O
) O
. O

Both O
are O
aligned O
north O
- O
south O
, O
one O
is O
in O
France O
and O
the O
other O
in O
Germany O
. O

They O
are O
geological O
related O
and O
divided O
from O
each O
other O
by O
the O
Rhine O
Rift O
. O

The O
Upper O
Rhine O
River O
runs O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
that O
valley O
which O
is O
also O
the O
country O
border O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
both O
mountain O
ranges O
have O
comparable O
confluences O
: O
48 O
° O
N O
7 O
° O
E O
( O
in O
France O
) O
and O
48 O
° O
N O
8 O
° O
E O
( O
in O
Germany O
) O
. O

Both O
are O
located O
in O
upper O
valleys O
that O
open O
out O
in O
the O
Rhine O
Rift O
. O

Both O
have O
similar O
heights O
( O
730 O
m O
and O
555 O
m O
) O
, O
both O
are O
in O
a O
mixed O
spruce O
and O
beech O
forest O
at O
steep O
grades O
. O

While O
visiting O
both O
confluence O
points O
, O
I O
noticed O
these O
striking O
similarities O
. O

Maybe O
40 O
Million O
years O
ago O
, O
before O
the O
rift O
had O
formed O
, O
they O
had O
been O
together O
at O
one O
location O
. O

 O
After O
documentation O
I O
went O
back O
to O
Freiburg O
, O
where O
I O
took O
a O
train O
back O
home O
to O
Zurich O
. O

Unfortunately O
I O
had O
to O
be O
in O
office O
the O
next O
day O
which O
did O
not O
leave O
riding O
back O
by O

as O
an O

    O
Biking O
from O
San O
Pedro O
Sula O
( O
Hondurasâ€ O
™ O
northwest O
corner O
) O
to O
El O
Salvador O
I O
was O
struck O
by O
two O
things O
. O

1 O
) O
The O
road O
was O
uphill O
the O
entire O
time O
and O
2 O
) O
most O
of O
Honduras O
is O
poor O
. O

    O
More O
so O
than O
in O
the O
other O
places O
I O
have O
biked O
, O
with O
perhaps O
the O
exception O
of O
parts O
of O
Chiapas O
, O
this O
region O
felt O
poor O
( O
see O
statistics O
) O
. O

It O
is O
not O
just O
the O
people O
walking O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
road O
– O
convenience O
stores O
were O
poorly O
stocked O
, O
and O
it O
was O
tough O
to O
eat O
well O
. O

Many O
houses O
are O
made O
out O
of O
mud O
bricks O
( O
adobe O
) O
, O
and O
the O
house O
on O
the O
left O
is O
on O
day O
4 O
of O
7 O
of O
construction O
. O

People O
were O
friendly O
, O
though O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
safe O
and O
comfortable O
. O

    O
I O
spent O
one O
night O
with O
a O
family O
who O
lived O
in O
a O
house O
half O
made O
of O
these O
bricks O
. O

They O
had O
no O
electricity O
or O
candles O
, O
although O
they O
did O
watch O
an O
hour O
of O
television O
every O
night O
using O
a O
car O
battery O
. O

They O
were O
extremely O
generous O
, O
and O
fed O
me O
tortillas O
that O
they O
made O
from O
their O
field O
of O
corn O
( O
they O
had O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
land O
, O
and O
enough O
food O
) O
. O

I O
gave O
them O
my O
headlamp O
, O
which O
I O
hope O
they O
are O
enjoying O
because O
it O
is O
now O
much O
more O
difficult O
for O
me O
to O
camp O
. O

    O
I O
visited O
a O
primary O
school O
, O
El O
Progreso O
. O

I O
set O
this O
visit O
up O
by O
biking O
by O
the O
school O
and O
having O
all O
the O
children O
, O
who O
were O
at O
recess O
, O
run O
out O
and O
stop O
me O
, O
asking O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
. O

    O
Thanks O
to O
the O
bomberos O
( O
firemen O
) O
of O
San O
Pedro O
Sula O
, O
who O
let O
me O
stay O
at O
their O
station O
. O

They O
were O
out O
fighting O
fires O
all O
night O
while O
I O
slept O
, O
and O
they O
also O
gave O
me O
a O
free O
â€˜Bomberos O
de O
Hondurasâ€ O

- O
shirt O
and O
decal O
. O

Also O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
the O
bomberos O
of O
Santa O

where O
I O
stayed O
two O

The O
Andean O
Paramo O
– O
the O
future O
of O
the O
mountaintops O
Monday O
, O
June O
19th O
, O
2006 O
    O
Before O
biking O
out O
of O
Bogota O
, O
a O
young O
professor O
from O
a O
local O
university O
took O
me O
into O
the O
mountains O
that O
overlook O
the O
city O
. O

Andres O
and O
I O
drove O
from O
8,500 O
feet O
at O
Bogota O
to O
11,000 O
feet O
and O
the O
national O
park O
of O
Chingaza O
. O

At O
this O
elevation O
, O
the O
pine O
forests O
give O
way O
to O
wet O
grassland O
known O
as O
the O
Andean O
paramo O
. O

    O
Hidden O
in O
the O
fog O
, O
Andres O
charged O
ahead O
, O
and O
I O
followed O
through O
a O
strange O
forest O
of O
dwarf O
palm O
like O
plants O
, O
which O
can O
be O
100 O
years O
old O
even O
though O
they O
stand O
only O
a O
few O
feet O
tall O
. O

According O
to O
Andresâ€ O
™ O
GPS O
, O
we O
climbed O
up O
to O
about O
12,500 O
feet O
, O
where O
the O
temperatures O
were O
in O
the O
low O
40s O
. O

    O
The O
region O
is O
a O
national O
park O
and O
protected O
because O
much O
of O
Bogota O
’s O
drinking O
water O
flows O
out O
of O
these O
highlands O
. O

The O
ground O
is O
rich O
in O
organic O
matter O
, O
and O
thus O
serves O
as O
a O
huge O
sponge O
, O
which O
stores O
water O
, O
cleans O
it O
, O
and O
releases O
it O
slowly O
, O
so O
that O
even O
in O
drier O
months O
there O
is O
a O
steady O
flow O
of O
water O
out O
of O
the O
park O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
sense O
of O
how O
sponge O
- O
like O
the O
ground O
is O
from O
the O
movies O
below O
center O
and O
left O
. O

On O
the O
right O
, O
I O
am O
drinking O
water O
straight O
from O
the O
steam O
( O
it O
was O
really O
good O
water O
) O
. O

    O
Over O
the O
past O
few O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
years O
, O
the O
earth O
has O
oscillated O
between O
cold O
spells O
, O
known O
as O
ice O
ages O
, O
and O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
we O
have O
today O
, O
known O
as O
interglacial O
periods O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
research O
, O
during O
the O
ice O
ages O
, O
the O
paramo O
grasslands O
could O
be O
found O
further O
down O
the O
mountains O
, O
covering O
a O
far O
larger O
area O
. O

During O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
today O
, O
the O
paramo O
is O
restricted O
to O
the O
mountaintops O
, O
literally O
islands O
of O
grassland O
in O
the O
Andes O
. O

    O
Climate O
change O
this O
century O
will O
likely O
push O
the O
planet O
far O
warmer O
than O
it O
has O
seen O
during O
these O
past O
glacial O
and O
interglacial O
cycles O
, O
and O
the O
paramo O
will O
have O
to O
move O
further O
up O
the O
mountainsides O
. O

But O
the O
ecosystem O
is O
already O
at O
the O
mountaintops O
, O
with O
nowhere O
to O
go O
, O
and O
the O
region O
is O
at O
risk O
. O

A O
drastically O
warmer O
earth O
might O
remove O
the O
paramo O
ecosystem O
, O
removing O
not O
only O
the O
valuable O
water O
storage O
and O
filtering O
it O
provides O
for O
Bogota O
, O
but O
also O
losing O
many O
unique O
species O
which O
are O
found O
only O
in O
this O
high O
Andean O
ecosystem O
. O

    O
Before O
leaving O
, O
we O
ran O
into O
a O
group O
of O
park O
rangers O
who O
study O
small O
deer O
that O
live O
in O
the O
park O
. O

Andres O
pulled O
out O
hot O
Colombian O
coffee O
in O
a O
thermos O
, O
some O
sandwiches O
, O
wine O
, O
and O
chocolate O
, O
and O
we O
all O
enjoyed O
a O
picnic O
between O
mountain O
lakes O
. O

Not O
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
this O
trip O
, O
I O
wondered O
if O
future O
generations O
would O
be O
able O
to O
enjoy O
the O
same O
place O
where O
I O
was O
standing O
. O

San O
Diego O
to O
Ensenada O
– O
3 O
days O
, O
130 O
miles O
Monday O
, O
December O
12th O
, O
2005 O
    O
After O
a O
week O
of O
preparation O
, O
I O
left O
San O
Diego O
at O
noon O
on O
Saturday O
, O
riding O
east O
through O
hilly O
suburbs O
. O

I O
took O
inland O
roads O
to O
avoid O
the O
busy O
highway O
along O
the O
coast O
near O
Tiajuana O
. O

As O
night O
came O
, O
I O
camped O
off O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
so O
that O
I O
could O
cross O
the O
border O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

    O
Bicycles O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
are O
not O
stopped O
when O
traveling O
into O
Mexico O
( O
see O
movie O
on O
the O
left O
) O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
just O
a O
little O
silly O
for O
waiting O
for O
a O
week O
to O
get O
my O
passport O
. O

Biking O
through O
Tecate O
, O
I O
noticed O
immediately O
that O
Mexicans O
use O
far O
less O
gas O
per O
person O
than O
Americans O
– O
every O
car O
that O
passed O
me O
had O
at O
least O
3 O
or O
more O
people O
sitting O
inside O
. O

    O
Biking O
the O
dry O
hills O
south O
of O
Tecate O
, O
I O
passed O
through O
many O
small O
and O
fairly O
uninhabited O
valleys O
before O
reaching O
a O
valley O
of O
vineyards O
near O
the O
coast O
. O

As O
dark O
approached O
, O
I O
asked O
local O
residents O
if O
there O
was O
a O
place O
I O
could O
pitch O
my O
tent O
. O

Julio O
quickly O
invited O
me O
to O
stay O
at O
his O
house O
, O
which O
he O
shares O
with O
his O
wife O
, O
daughter O
, O
and O
parents O
, O
and O
which O
they O
built O
themselves O
20 O
years O
ago O
. O

They O
spoke O
no O
English O
. O

My O
Spanish O
is O
rapidly O
improving O
. O

    O
The O
next O
day O
was O
a O
short O
ride O
to O
Ensenada O
, O
where O
I O
checked O
the O
internet O
to O
see O
which O
school O
I O
was O
going O
to O
visit O
( O
from O
email O
) O
, O
and O
then O
biked O
to O
Centro O
Educativo O
Patria O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
prinicipal O
as O
well O
as O
the O
partial O
owner O
of O
the O
school O
( O
they O
are O
married O
) O
generously O
invited O
me O
to O
stay O
at O
their O
ranch O
. O

At O
the O
ranch O
, O
although O
they O
only O
recently O
purchased O
a O
refrigerator O
and O
use O
electricity O
sparingly O
, O
the O
family O
lives O
well O
. O

They O
make O
their O
own O
wine O
and O
olive O
oil O
, O
laugh O
often O
, O
and O
managed O
to O
feed O
a O
hungry O
bicyclist O
extremely O
well O
. O

    O
I O
am O
fearful O
of O
the O
number O
of O
postcards O
/ O
thank O
you O
cards O
I O
will O
have O
to O
send O
down O
the O
road O

Bogota O
, O
the O
Bicycle O
, O
and O
Transportation O
Monday O
, O
June O
19th O
, O
2006 O
    O
Climbing O
into O
the O
mountains O
, O
I O
reached O
the O
high O
plain O
were O
Bogota O
, O
at O
9,000 O
ft O
above O
sea O
level O
, O
sits O
. O

Bogota O
is O
far O
off O
my O
route O
( O
see O
map O
) O
, O
and O
you O
might O
be O
wondering O
why O
I O
chose O
to O
bike O
to O
the O
capital O
of O
Colombia O
. O

    O
In O
the O
1990s O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
horrible O
road O
congestion O
, O
Bogota O
did O
something O
amazing O
â€ O
“ O
it O
reduced O
space O
for O
cars O
. O

The O
city O
removed O
lanes O
from O
a O
number O
of O
major O
thruways O
to O
make O
way O
for O
new O
high O
- O
speed O
busses O
, O
and O
sidewalks O
that O
were O
used O
for O
parking O
cars O
were O
replaced O
by O
pedestrian O
walkways O
and O
bikeways O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
pedestrian O
bridges O
were O
built O
, O
allowing O
people O
to O
easily O
pass O
over O
the O
major O
roads O
of O
the O
city O
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
city O
was O
redesigned O
around O
people O
instead O
of O
around O
the O
automobile O
. O

    O
I O
talked O
with O
a O
number O
of O
locals O
about O
how O
the O
city O
had O
changed O
. O

Some O
cited O
statistics O
– O
whereas O
traveling O
across O
the O
city O
used O
to O
take O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
the O
new O
bus O
system O
, O
named O
the O
â€˜transmilenioâ€ O
™ O
will O
take O
perhaps O
45 O
minutes O
. O

Safety O
has O
improved O
as O
well O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
traffic O
accidents O
reduce O
significantly O
, O
but O
violent O
crime O
also O
nearly O
halved O
( O
here O
is O
an O
article O
about O
this O
) O
. O

Most O
people O
, O
though O
, O
remarked O
that O
Bogota O
is O
simply O
a O
nicer O
place O
to O
live O
and O
people O
respect O
the O
city O
more O
. O

â€˜People O
throw O
less O
trash O
in O
the O
streetâ€ O
™ O
, O
I O
was O
told O
, O
and O
â€˜now O
people O
are O
proud O
to O
be O
from O
Bogota.â€ O
™ O
    O
I O
stayed O
for O
a O
few O
days O
with O
Ricardo O
( O
shown O
below O
on O
the O
left O
) O
, O
who O
runs O
Ciudad O
Humana O
( O
‘ O
human O
city O
’ O
) O
, O
a O
foundation O
that O
promotes O
improved O
civil O
life O
and O
transportation O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
foundation O
is O
a O
strong O
supporter O
of O
bicycle O
use O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
I O
spent O
much O
time O
with O
this O
group O
. O

I O
helped O
with O
a O
project O
to O
fix O
bicycles O
in O
the O
southern O
( O
poorer O
) O
region O
of O
town O
and O
also O
gave O
presentations O
to O
groups O
of O
young O
people O
who O
are O
learning O
how O
to O
be O
bike O
mechanics O
. O

    O
Bogota O
now O
has O
over O
300 O
km O
of O
dedicated O
bike O
routes O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
I O
biked O
at O
least O
half O
of O
them O
in O
my O
week O
in O
Bogota O
. O

According O
to O
Ricardo O
, O
since O
the O
installation O
of O
the O
ciclorutas O
, O
bicycle O
use O
has O
increased O
5 O
times O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
now O
there O
are O
probably O
between O
300,000 O
and O
400,000 O
trips O
made O
daily O
in O
Bogota O
by O
bicycle O
. O

A O
large O
portion O
of O
this O
use O
is O
in O
the O
southern O
, O
poorer O
region O
of O
town O
, O
and O
I O
joined O
Ricardo O
and O
a O
few O
other O
members O
of O
Ciudad O
Humana O
one O
morning O
to O
bike O
across O
the O
city O
and O
see O
the O
rush O
hour O
bike O
traffic O
. O

    O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
ciclorutas O
are O
not O
perfect O
. O

There O
are O
many O
places O
in O
the O
city O
where O
they O
do O
not O
connect O
, O
and O
you O
may O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
man O
shown O
in O
the O
photo O
on O
the O
right O
. O

Also O
, O
they O
are O
placed O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
in O
such O
a O
way O
so O
as O
to O
put O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
in O
competition O
( O
you O
can O
watch O
the O
video O
on O
the O
right O
to O
understand O
this O
) O
. O

But O
the O
ciclorutas O
are O
nonetheless O
incredibly O
successful O
, O
showing O
that O
with O
more O
investment O
, O
even O
more O
is O
possible O
. O

    O
I O
spent O
my O
last O
day O
in O
the O
city O
enjoying O
the O
ciclovia O
, O
an O
event O
every O
Sunday O
where O
many O
roads O
are O
closed O
to O
cars O
and O
open O
only O
for O
bicycles O
. O

Apparently O
, O
I O
saw O
it O
on O
a O
low O
turnout O
day O
( O
blame O
the O
world O
cup O
– O
Brazil O
was O
playing O
) O
, O
but O
the O
roads O
were O
still O
filled O
with O
bicycles O
and O
people O
out O
to O
enjoy O
themselves O
. O

( O
The O
clowns O
on O
the O
right O
are O
in O
charge O
of O
making O
fun O
of O
people O
without O
helmets O
. O

) O
    O
The O
new O
Bogota O
has O
another O
benefit O
as O
well O
â€ O
“ O
people O
are O
traveling O
more O
efficiently O
, O
using O
fewer O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

Indeed O
, O
redesigning O
Bogota O
around O
people O
and O
bicycles O
has O
not O
only O
improved O
the O
safety O
, O
health O
, O
and O
pride O
of O
its O
citizens O
, O
but O
the O
city O
has O
also O
reduced O
its O
effect O
on O
the O
global O
environment O
. O

This O
is O
a O
win O
- O
win O
situation O
â€ O
“ O
better O
city O
living O
and O
less O
carbon O
dioxide O
emissions O
. O

Hopefully O
, O

 O
I O
am O
personally O
very O
excited O
for O
this O
trip O
– O
having O
traveled O
Latin O
America O
, O
I O
know O
that O
the O
entire O
world O
must O
take O
action O
against O
global O
warming O
and O
that O
developing O
countries O
will O
not O
take O
the O
issue O
seriously O
unless O
those O
of O
us O
in O
the O
United O
States O
take O
the O
lead O
. O

I O
beleive O
that O
Bill O
and O
I O
( O
and O
those O
of O
you O
who O
help O
us O
) O
can O
make O
a O
difference O
and O
convince O
people O
along O
this O
route O
to O
take O
action O
. O

 O
I O
will O
send O
out O
my O
travel O
update O
in O
two O
more O

Gregg O
, O
Brooks O
, O
and O
I O
crossed O
into O
Guatemala O
from O
Mexico O
by O
riding O
in O
a O
small O
boat O
across O
the O
Usumacinta O
River O
. O

Although O
this O
region O
is O
sparsely O
populated O
, O
I O
noticed O
an O
immediate O
change O
in O
the O
people O
across O
the O
border O
. O

The O
children O
, O
instead O
of O
asking O
me O
how O
much O
my O
bike O
was O
worth O
( O
as O
nearly O
every O
person O
in O
Chiapas O
asked O
) O
, O
smiled O
, O
played O
with O
my O
bike O
seat O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
say O
‘ O
how O
are O
you O
’ O
in O
English O
. O

The O
police O
told O
me O
no O
one O
had O
been O
attacked O
on O
the O
road O
in O
three O
years O
, O
and O
I O
rode O
the O
dirt O
road O
until O
I O
found O
a O
small O
town O
where O
locals O
allowed O
me O
to O
camp O
. O

Gregg O
and O
Brooks O
continued O
by O
van O
, O
and O
we O
split O
ways O
. O

    O
Thinly O
populated O
, O
northern O
Guatemala O
is O
mostly O
flat O
and O
is O
covered O
by O
thick O
rainforest O
except O
for O
places O
cleared O
for O
crops O
or O
cattle O
. O

Riding O
a O
day O
and O
a O
half O
, O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
ruins O
of O
Tikal O
, O
a O
city O
that O
was O
once O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
and O
most O
important O
cities O
of O
the O
ancient O
Maya O
. O

The O
Mayan O
civilization O
thrived O
from O
a O
few O
centuries O
before O
Christ O
until O
around O
900 O
AD O
, O
when O
the O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
and O
nearly O
all O
cities O
across O
the O
peninsula O
were O
abandoned O
. O

Now O
the O
impressive O
stone O
pyramids O
and O
palaces O
are O
covered O
by O
jungle O
and O
tourists O
. O

    O
The O
Tikal O
ruins O
sit O
near O
the O
large O
lake O
of O
Peten O
- O
Itza O
, O
and O
I O
stayed O
in O
a O
hotel O
overlooking O
this O
lake O
for O
$ O
5 O
a O
night O
while O
nursing O
a O
small O
cold O
. O

Here O
I O
met O
with O
a O
group O
of O
researchers O
who O
are O
drilling O
into O
the O
lake O
’s O
bottom O
, O
attempting O
to O
determine O
the O
past O
climate O
of O
the O
region O
. O

By O
looking O
at O
the O
composition O
of O
layers O
of O
sediment O
on O
the O
lake O
’s O
bottom O
, O
the O
scientists O
can O
determine O
past O
rainfall O
patterns O
and O
temperature O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
type O
of O
vegetation O
that O
surrounded O
the O
lake O
. O

     O
According O
to O
their O
research O
, O
around O
900AD O
, O
when O
the O
Mayan O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
a O
series O
of O
intense O
droughts O
struck O
the O
region O
, O
likely O
making O
it O
difficult O
for O
the O
Mayans O
to O
feed O
their O
large O
cities O
. O

The O
lake O
sediments O
also O
suggest O
major O
deforestation O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
a O
combination O
of O
drought O
and O
land O
degradation O
led O
the O
Mayans O
to O
abandon O
their O
settlements O
. O

We O
can O
not O
be O
sure O
of O
how O
the O
Mayan O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
but O
it O
now O
seems O
that O
climate O
change O
helped O
end O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
ancient O
civilizations O
of O
the O
new O
world O
. O

 O
Peru O
Monday O
, O
October O
16th O
, O
2006 O
    O
As O
I O
said O
in O
the O
last O
entry O
, O
Peru O
’s O
coast O
is O
home O
to O
one O
of O
the O
driest O
deserts O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Despite O
the O
constant O
fog O
, O
it O
almost O
never O
rains O
â€ O
“ O
my O
tour O
guide O
for O
an O
exhibit O
in O
Lima O
told O
me O
that O
the O
last O
time O
there O
was O
heavy O
rain O
was O
35 O
years O
ago O
. O

    O
All O
of O
the O
water O
for O
the O
city O
comes O
from O
the O
mountains O
, O
where O
it O
falls O
as O
rain O
or O
snow O
and O
then O
melts O
, O
filling O
the O
rivers O
. O

During O
the O
dry O
season O
, O
half O
of O
the O
year O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
water O
is O
from O
melting O
snow O
and O
ice O
. O

Unfortuantely O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
these O
glaciers O
are O
going O
to O
melt O
and O
dissapear O
in O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
. O

It O
is O
unclear O
where O
Peruvians O
will O
get O
their O
water O
from O
when O
the O
glaciers O
are O
gone O
. O

    O
The O
countryâ€ O
™ O
s O
energy O
supply O
is O
also O
at O
risk O
. O

According O
to O
people O
I O
talked O
to O
at O
PROCLIM O
, O
a O
project O
aimed O
at O
preparing O
Peru O
for O
global O
warming O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
Peruâ€ O
™ O
s O
electricity O
is O
hydroelectric O
, O
and O
, O
during O
the O
dry O
season O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
water O
in O
the O
dams O
is O
from O
glacial O
runoff O
. O

Unless O
investment O
for O
huge O
new O
dams O
is O
found O
, O
Peru O
might O
have O
to O
switch O
to O
using O
fossil O
fuels O
to O
produce O
its O
electricity O
. O

    O
All O
of O
this O
will O
take O
place O
in O
a O
country O
where O
I O
have O
already O
seen O
many O
water O
problems O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
towns O
and O
cities O
I O
have O
been O
in O
( O
including O
parts O
of O
Lima O
) O
have O
certain O
hours O
of O
the O
day O
when O
the O
city O
does O
not O
provide O
water O
. O

In O
one O
rural O
area O
east O
of O
the O
Cordillera O
Blanca O
, O
I O
met O
a O
man O
working O
for O
the O
government O
whose O
job O
it O
is O
to O
resolve O
water O
disputes O
. O

â€˜It O
is O
a O
big O
problem O
here O
. O

I O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
each O
day O
the O
water O
goes O
to O
a O
different O
house.â€ O
™ O
A O
farmer O
I O
stayed O
with O
near O
the O
coast O
pointed O
to O
a O
number O
of O
his O
crops O
and O
said O
that O
they O
would O
be O
twice O
as O
high O
if O
not O
for O
a O
shortage O
of O
water O
. O

And O
every O
person O
who O
lives O
near O
a O
stream O
tells O
me O
the O
same O
story O
: O
the O
streams O
are O
more O
variable O
than O
they O
used O
to O
be O
. O

In O
the O
dry O
season O
there O
is O
less O
water O
, O
and O
in O
the O
rainy O
season O
there O
is O
more O
â€ O
“ O
just O
as O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
decreasing O
snow O
pack O
. O

( O
To O
be O
fair O
, O
this O
is O
also O
due O
to O
deforestation O
as O
well O
as O
loss O
of O
snow O
and O
ice O
. O

) O
    O
Loosing O
the O
glaciers O
and O
snow O
of O
the O
mountains O
will O
be O
a O
major O
loss O
for O
Peru O
. O

The O
only O
solution O
may O
be O
to O
build O
many O
new O
resivours O
in O
the O
mountains O
. O

But O
, O
what O
valleys O
will O
they O
choose O
to O
flood O
? O

What O
will O
happen O
to O
the O
people O
living O
in O
these O
valleys O
? O

And O
, O
how O
will O
Peru O
, O
a O
poor O
country O
, O
find O
the O
investment O
for O
such O
expensive O
projects O
? O

FOR O
COLOMBIA O

    O
Due O

, O
many O
of O
the O

areas O
I O
visited O
, O
and O
especially O
the O
historic O
city O
of O
Cartagena O
in O
Colombia O
, O
are O
at O
risk O
. O

The O
water O
source O
for O
Bogota O
, O
Colombiaâ€ O
™ O
s O
capital O
, O
is O
also O
at O
risk O
( O
see O
journal O
entry O
) O
, O
as O
the O
ecosystem O
that O
supplies O
the O
water O
sits O
at O
the O
mountain O
tops O
and O
may O
not O
survive O
global O
warming O
. O

This O
would O
also O
undoubtedly O
cause O
extinctions O
. O

In O
my O
journals O
, O
I O
also O
wrote O
about O
floods O
in O
Caracas O
as O
well O
as O
potential O
droughts O
in O
the O
Amazon O
â€ O
“ O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
that O
global O
warming O
will O
cause O
the O
Amazon O
to O
dry O
out O
. O

I O
also O
wrote O
about O
the O
coral O
reefs O
that O
I O
visited O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
Venezuela O
â€ O
“ O
these O
too O
are O
at O
risk O
. O

    O
One O
topic O
I O
have O
not O
discussed O
in O
my O
journals O
, O
but O
hope O
to O
do O
so O
, O
is O
the O
possible O
spread O
of O
tropical O
diseases O
. O

In O
Colombia O
and O
Venezuela O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
lives O
in O
the O
mountains O
, O
where O
it O
is O
too O
cold O
for O
many O
tropical O
diseases O
such O
as O
malaria O
or O
dengue O
. O

As O
the O
climate O
warms O
, O
more O
of O
these O
centers O
may O
be O
exposed O
to O
such O
diseases O
. O

A O
School O
in O
Huaraz O
– O
What O
do O
I O
say O
to O
public O
schools O
? O

Thursday O
, O
September O
28th O
, O
2006 O
    O
In O
Huaraz O
, O
hoping O
to O
give O
a O
school O
presentation O
, O
I O
arrived O
at O
Santa O
Rosa O
de O
Viterbo O
, O
a O
good O
public O
school O
, O
just O
as O
students O
were O
arriving O
. O

The O
entire O
school O
was O
gathering O
for O
their O
morning O
assembly O
of O
announcements O
and O
prayer O
( O
it O
is O
a O
Catholic O
school O
) O
, O
and O
, O
after O
handing O
the O
director O
my O
business O
card O
and O
showing O
off O
my O
fully O
loaded O
touring O
bike O
, O
the O
director O
surprised O
me O
by O
immediately O
leading O
me O
on O
stage O
and O
handing O
me O
the O
microphone O
, O
giving O
me O
five O
minutes O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
entire O
school O
. O

    O
What O
do O
I O
say O
to O
these O
public O
schools O
, O
where O
they O
do O
n’t O
have O
a O
power O
point O
projector O
and O
where O
the O
students O
have O
a O
very O
small O
effect O
on O
global O
warming O
? O

( O
see O
comparison O
of O
U.S. O
and O
Peru O
) O
I O
first O
admit O
that O
my O
country O
pollutes O
enourmaously O
and O
has O
to O
take O
action O
â€ O
“ O
and O
for O
that O
, O
when O
I O
am O
done O
, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
return O
and O
bike O
the O
U.S. O
, O
encouraging O
North O
Americans O
to O
act O
. O

But O
I O
also O
emphasize O
that O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
a O
global O
problem O
which O
we O
all O
need O
to O
work O
together O
to O
solve O
. O

I O
then O
talk O
about O
local O
pollution O
and O
global O
pollution O
â€ O
“ O
asking O
if O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
throw O
trash O
in O
the O
rivers O
or O
streets O
when O
that O
space O
is O
shared O
by O
the O
people O
in O
their O
town O
, O
or O
if O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
pollute O
the O
atmosphere O
when O
that O
space O
is O
shared O
by O
the O
worldâ€ O
™ O
s O
6.5 O
billion O
people O
( O
I O
ask O
them O
all O
to O
learn O
that O
number O
! O

) O
. O

As O
many O
of O
them O
own O
bicycles O
, O
I O
finally O
talk O
about O
the O
benefits O
of O
bicycle O
transport O
as O
a O
cheaper O
and O
healthier O
way O
to O
travel O
. O

    O
At O
the O
least O
, O
I O
hope O
to O
give O
an O
idea O
of O
caring O
for O
the O
spaces O
that O
we O
share O
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
show O
that O
there O
are O
people O
in O
the O
United O
States O
that O
care O
about O
this O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
measure O
the O
effect O
of O
visits O
like O
this O
, O
but O
I O
occasionally O
receive O
positive O
emails O
from O
students O
, O
suggesting O
that O
I O
am O
, O
at O
least O
, O
having O
some O
effect O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
put O
recent O
experiences O
into O
an O
entry O
here O
â€ O
“ O
this O
trip O
amazes O
me O
every O
day O
with O
new O
people O
and O
experiences O
, O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
keep O
up O
in O
the O
personal O
journal O
I O
write O
. O

This O
blog O
is O
a O
balance O
between O
providing O
interesting O
stories O
and O
not O
overloading O
this O
site O
â€ O
“ O
there O
are O
many O
experiences O
that O
you O
donâ€ O
™ O
t O
read O
about O
. O

    O
Heading O
south O
from O
Queretaro O
, O
I O
camped O
the O
first O
night O
next O
to O
the O
house O
of O
a O
family O
who O
grew O
their O
own O
corn O
, O
which O
they O
eat O
and O
feed O
to O
their O
chickens O
and O
sheep O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
I O
watched O
while O
the O
mother O
of O
the O
house O
and O
her O
neighbor O
hand O
- O
made O
tortillas O
. O

They O
make O
500 O
tortillas O
five O
times O
a O
week O
, O
and O
you O
should O
watch O
the O
two O
videos O
on O
the O
left O
. O

The O
daughter O
of O
the O
house O
dreams O
of O
moving O
to O
the O
U.S. O
and O
buying O
a O
Ford O
Mustang O
. O

( O
Many O
people O
in O
these O
small O
towns O
have O
worked O
in O
the O
U.S. O
, O
and O
most O
have O
family O
working O
abroad O
. O

) O
    O
The O
land O
south O
of O
Queretaro O
receives O
more O
rain O
than O
the O
land O
to O
the O
north O
, O
and O
I O
traveled O
south O
through O
a O
patchwork O
of O
small O
corn O
fields O
. O

The O
harvest O
was O
in O
the O
fall O
and O
the O
land O
is O
mostly O
bare O
or O
covered O
with O
dry O
dead O
corn O
stalks O
. O

    O
After O
staying O
with O
the O
bomberos O
( O
firemen O
) O
of O
the O
small O
town O
of O
Maravatio O
, O
I O
climbed O
to O
11,000 O
feet O
where O
I O
encountered O
the O
first O
forest O
I O
have O
seen O
since O
Durango O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
butterflies O
are O

    O
Heading O
south O
from O
Puerto O
Ordaz O
/ O
Ciudad O
Guyana O
( O
the O
city O
seems O
to O
have O
two O
names O
) O
, O
I O
followed O
the O
only O
road O
that O
connects O
Venezuela O
and O
Brazil O
. O

Thinly O
populated O
, O
this O
road O
follows O
jungle O
before O
climbing O
into O
a O
region O
known O
as O
â€˜La O
Gran O
Sabana O
, O
â€ O
™ O
a O
high O
grassland O
with O
strange O
flat O
toped O
mountains O
and O
many O
rivers O
and O
waterfalls O
. O

( O
This O
is O
where O
Angel O
Falls O
, O
the O
worldâ€ O
™ O
s O
tallest O
waterfall O
, O
is O
found O
â€ O
“ O
it O
was O
too O
far O
off O
my O
route O
, O
though O
) O
. O

I O
slowed O
down O
through O
this O
part O
, O
camping O
on O
the O
high O
mesas O
and O
swimming O
in O
the O
many O
pools O
, O
meeting O
vacationing O
Venezuelans O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

    O
Entering O
Brazil O
, O
the O
road O
descended O
from O
the O
mountains O
into O
the O
Amazon O
basin O
, O
where O
, O
after O
two O
days O
of O
riding O
, O
I O
arrived O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Boa O
Vista O
. O

Before O
entering O
town O
, O
I O
went O
swimming O
with O
a O
few O
teenagers O
( O
photo O
right O
) O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
kids O
if O
I O
should O
worry O
about O
piranhas O
or O
crocodiles O
, O
to O
which O
they O
said O
â€˜donâ€ O
™ O
t O
worry O
about O
it.â€ O
™ O
    O
In O
Brazil O
, O
unlike O
almost O
every O
country O
I O
have O
visited O
, O
the O
language O
is O
Portuguese O
instead O
of O
Spanish O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
Spanish O
and O
Portuguese O
are O
very O
similar O
languages O
, O
and O
sometimes O
I O
almost O
understand O
what O
people O
say O
. O

Also O
, O
some O
important O
phrases O
, O
such O
as O
â€˜where O
is O
the O
fire O
stationâ€ O
™ O
are O
almost O
the O
same O
in O
both O
languages O
. O

In O
Boa O
Vista O
, O
where O
I O
stayed O
for O
two O
days O
, O
I O
gave O
a O
talk O
at O
a O
middle O
school O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
say O
a O
few O
words O
in O
Portuguese O
, O
and O
, O
whenever O
what O
I O
said O
was O
unintelligible O
, O
the O
teacher O
next O
to O
me O
would O
repeat O
what O
I O
said O
in O
Portuguese O
( O
many O
people O
here O
understand O
Spanish O
) O
. O

The O
bombeiros O
( O
firefighters O
) O
, O
who O
I O
stayed O
with O
two O
nights O
, O
also O
had O
time O
to O
help O
me O
congegate O
verbs O
, O
and O
, O
when O
I O
was O
interviewed O
by O
the O
local O
television O
, O
I O
mostly O
understood O
the O
questions O
and O
gave O
responses O
that O
might O
have O
been O
understood O
. O

    O
Continuing O
south O
, O
I O
followed O
the O
only O
major O
road O
through O
this O
section O
of O
the O
Amazon O
. O

While O
most O
of O
this O
region O
is O
pure O
jungle O
, O
and O
there O
are O
very O
few O
people O
and O
towns O
, O
about O
half O
the O
time O
the O
roadside O
is O
cleared O
for O
cattle O
grazing O
. O

The O
cleared O
land O
, O
however O
, O
did O
make O
it O
easier O
to O
see O
the O
many O
types O
of O
birds O
( O
The O
shot O
on O
the O
right O
shows O
me O
crossing O
the O
equator O
) O
. O

    O
Further O
south O
, O
however O
, O
a O
75 O
mile O
stretch O
of O
road O
is O
indigenous O
land O
, O
reserved O
for O
the O
native O
peoples O
, O
and O
this O
is O
pure O
jungle O
. O

The O
natives O
do O
not O
like O
outsiders O
on O
their O
land O
, O
and O
you O
are O
only O
allowed O
to O
pass O
this O
section O
during O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
you O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
stop O
. O

In O
talking O
with O
people O
on O
the O
road O
( O
talking O
in O
Portuguese O
, O
where O
we O
had O
to O
say O
everything O
a O
few O
times O
) O
, O
I O
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
afraid O
everyone O
was O
of O
the O
Indian O
reservation O
and O
the O
jungle O
. O

Most O
said O
I O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
pass O
through O
this O
section O
of O
road O
. O

I O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
just O
prejudice O
against O
the O
natives O
. O

Before O
I O
entered O
the O
reserve O
, O
one O
man O
told O
me O
I O
would O
be O
‘ O
killed O
and O
eaten O
’ O
by O
the O
natives O
, O
and O
then O
he O
added O
something O
that O
I O
did O
n’t O
understand O
and O
acted O
out O
some O
type O
of O
animal O
with O
large O
claws O
attacking O
me O
. O

I O
was O
ready O
to O
dismiss O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
, O
but O
then O
he O
said O
‘ O
and O
, O
this O
woman O
had O
her O
husband O
killed O
and O
eaten O
by O
the O
natives O
. O

’ O
The O
woman O
walked O
over O
and O
confirmed O
what O
the O
man O
had O
said O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
reconsidered O
traveling O
slowly O
on O
a O
bike O
through O
the O
reserve O
. O

    O
At O
the O
reserveÂ´s O
entrance O
, O
though O
, O
a O
police O
officer O
changed O
my O
mind O
. O

He O
told O
me O
that O
such O
attacks O
were O
far O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
that O
they O
would O
never O
happen O
along O
the O
road O
in O
the O
daytime O
– O
the O
tribes O
would O
harm O
only O
people O
who O
enter O
their O
reserve O
where O
they O
are O
not O
supposed O
to O
. O

Ok O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
and O
continued O
to O
bike O
the O
75 O
miles O
, O
stopping O
only O
to O
pee O
and O
get O
more O
food O
out O
of O
my O
pannier O
( O
I O
ate O
while O
biking O
) O
. O

The O
jungle O
here O
was O
thick O
and O
alive O
– O
I O
saw O
numerous O
monkeys O
( O
scared O
a O
few O
crossing O
the O
road O
) O
, O
a O
small O
deer O
like O
animal O
, O
and O
heard O
many O
sounds O
that O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
elsewhere O
along O
the O
road O
. O

    O
On O
the O
exit O
to O
the O
reserve O
, O
I O
stopped O
at O
a O
building O
where O
some O
of O
the O
indigenous O
people O
were O
selling O
crarftwork O
. O

Both O
of O
us O
speaking O
Portuguese O
, O
which O
is O
neither O
of O
our O
first O
languages O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
yes O
, O
these O
people O
still O
hunt O
with O
bow O
and O
arrows O
and O
no O
, O
they O
do O
not O
drink O
any O
coca O
- O
cola O
( O
they O
did O
look O
very O
healthy O
) O
. O

I O
asked O
about O
bicycles O
crossing O
the O
reserve O
, O
and O
the O
man O
said O
‘ O
it O
is O
allowed O
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
like O
it O
. O

’ O
    O
After O
two O
more O
days O
of O
travel O
, O
mostly O
through O
rolling O
hills O
, O
I O
arrived O
in O
the O
large O
city O
of O
Manaus O
, O
which O
sits O
where O
the O
Rio O
Negro O
meets O
the O
Amazon O
River O
. O

I O
will O
be O
here O
for O
a O
few O
days O
before O
taking O
a O
boat O
up O
the O
Amazon O
river O
and O
into O
Peru O

turning MOTION
off MOTION_SIGNAL
down MOTION_SIGNAL
the O

We SPATIAL_ENTITY

 O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY

I SPATIAL_ENTITY

walk MOTION

my O

take O
the O

The O

a O

because O
much O
of O
Bogota O

drinking O
water SPATIAL_ENTITY
flows MOTION
out MOTION_SIGNAL
of MOTION_SIGNAL
of O
these O
highlands PLACE
. O

The O
ground SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
rich O
in O
organic O
matter SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
and O
thus O
serves O
as O
a O
huge O
sponge SPATIAL_ENTITY

which O
stores O
water SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
cleans O
it SPATIAL_ENTITY

and O
releases MOTION
it SPATIAL_ENTITY

so O
that O
even O

there O

You O
can O
get O

how O
sponge O

    O
Over O
the O
past O
few O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
years O
, O
the O
earth O
has O
oscillated O
between O
cold O

known O

and O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
we O
have O
today O
, O
known O
as O
interglacial O
periods O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
research O
, O
during O
the O
ice O
ages O
, O
the O
paramo O
grasslands PLACE
could O
be O
found O
further O
down SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountains PLACE
, O
covering SPATIAL_SIGNAL
a O
far O
larger O
area PLACE
. O

During O
warm O
periods O
, O
such O
as O
today O
, O
the O
paramo PLACE
is O
restricted SPATIAL_SIGNAL
to O
the O
mountaintops PLACE
, O
literally O
islands PLACE
of O
grassland O
in SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
Andes PATH
. O

    O
Climate O
change O
this O
century O
will O
likely O
push O
the O
planet O
far O
warmer O
than O
it O
has O
seen O
during O
these O
past O
glacial O
and O
interglacial O
cycles O
, O
and O
the O
paramo PLACE
will O
have O
to O
move MOTION
further O
up MOTION_SIGNAL
the O
mountainsides PATH
. O

But O
the O
ecosystem SPATIAL_ENTITY
is O
already O
at SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
mountaintops PLACE
, O
with O
nowhere O
to O
go O
, O
and O
the O
region O
is O
at O
risk O
. O

A O
drastically O
warmer O
earth O
might O
remove O
the O
paramo O
ecosystem SPATIAL_ENTITY
, O
removing O
not O
only O
the O
valuable O
water O
storage O
and O
filtering O
it O
provides O
for O
Bogota PLACE

but O
also O
losing O
many O
unique O

are O
found O
only O

this O
high O

    O
Before O
leaving MOTION

we SPATIAL_ENTITY
ran MOTION
into MOTION_SIGNAL
a O
group SPATIAL_ENTITY

who O
study O
small O

live NONMOTION_EVENT

some O

Not O
for O

In O

Bogota PLACE
did O
something O

â€ O
“ O
it O
reduced MOTION

The O
city O
removed O

A O

the O
new O

named O
the O
â€˜transmilenioâ€ O

45 O

Not O

also O
nearly O

According O
to O
Ricardo O
, O
since O
the O
installation O
of O
the O
ciclorutas PATH
, O
bicycle O
use O
has O
increased O
5 O
times O

now O
there O
are O

and O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
joined MOTION
Ricardo SPATIAL_ENTITY

a O
few O
other O
members SPATIAL_ENTITY
of O
Ciudad O

one O
morning O
to O
bike MOTION
across MOTION_SIGNAL
the O
city PLACE
and O
see O
the O
rush O
hour O
bike O
traffic SPATIAL_ENTITY
. O

    O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
ciclorutas PATH
are O
not O
perfect O
. O

There O
are O
many O
places PLACE
in SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city PLACE
where SPATIAL_SIGNAL
they PATH
do O
not O
connect MOTION
, O
and O
you O
may O
find O
yourself O
in O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
man O
shown O
in O
the O
photo O
on O
the O
right O
. O

Also O
, O
they PATH
are O
placed O
on SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
sidewalk PATH
in O
such O
a O
way O
so O
as O
to O
put O
pedestrians O
and O
cyclists O
in O
competition O
( O
you O
can O
watch O
the O
video O
on O
the O
right O
to O
understand O
this O
) O
. O

But O
the O
ciclorutas PATH
are O
nonetheless O
incredibly O
successful O
, O
showing O
that O
with O
more O
investment O
, O
even O
more O
is O
possible O
. O

    O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
spent NONMOTION_EVENT
my O
last O
day O
in SPATIAL_SIGNAL
the O
city PLACE
enjoying O
the O
ciclovia O
, O
an O
event O
every O
Sunday O
where O
many O
roads O
are O
closed O
to O
cars O
and O
open O
only O
for O
bicycles O
. O

Apparently O
, O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
saw O
it O
on O
a O
low O
turnout O
day O
( O
blame O
the O
world O
cup O
– O
Brazil PLACE
was O
playing O
) O
, O
but O
the O
roads PATH
were O
still O
filled SPATIAL_SIGNAL
with O
bicycles SPATIAL_ENTITY
and O
people SPATIAL_ENTITY
out O
to O
enjoy O
themselves O
. O

( O
The O
clowns O
on O
the O
right O
are O
in O
charge O
of O
making O
fun O
of O
people O
without O
helmets O
. O

) O
    O
The O
new O
Bogota PLACE
has O
another O
benefit O
as O
well O
â€ O
“ O
people SPATIAL_ENTITY
are O
traveling MOTION
more O
efficiently O
, O
using O
fewer O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

Indeed O
, O
redesigning O
Bogota PLACE
around O
people O
and O
bicycles O
has O
not O
only O
improved O
the O
safety O
, O
health O
, O
and O
pride O
of O
its O
citizens O
, O
but O
the O
city O
has O
also O
reduced O
its O
effect O
on O
the O
global O
environment O
. O

This O
is O
a O
win O
- O
win O
situation O
â€ O
“ O
better O
city O
living O
and O
less O
carbon O

Hopefully O

     O
According O
to O
their O
research O
, O
around O
900AD O
, O
when O
the O
Mayan O
civilization O
collapsed O
, O
a O
series O
of O
intense O
droughts O
struck O
the O
region O
, O
likely O
making O
it O
difficult O
for O
the O
Mayans O
to O
feed O
their O
large O
cities O
. O

The O
lake O
sediments O
also O
suggest O
major O
deforestation O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
a O
combination O
of O
drought O
and O
land O

led O
the O
Mayans SPATIAL_ENTITY

abandon MOTION

We O
can O
not O

how O
the O

it O

five O

the O

    O
What O
do O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
say O
to O
these O

where O
they O
do O

( O
see O
comparison O

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
first O
admit O
that O
my O

take O
action O
â€ O
“ O
and O
for O
that O

But O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
also O
emphasize O
that O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
am O
talking O
about O
a O
global O
problem O
which O
we O
all O
need O
to O
work O
together O
to O
solve O
. O

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
then O
talk O
about O
local O
pollution O

pollution O
â€ O
“ O

As O

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
finally O
talk O
about O
the O

    O
At O

, O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
hope O

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
thought O
that O
this O

just O
prejudice O

Before O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
entered MOTION

one O

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
would O
be O
‘ O
killed O

by O
the O

and O
then O
he O
added O
something O
that O
I SPATIAL_ENTITY
did O

understand O

acted O
out O
some O
type O
of O
animal O
with O
large O

attacking O
me SPATIAL_ENTITY

I SPATIAL_ENTITY
was O
ready O
to O
dismiss O
what O
he O
was O
saying O

then O
he O
said O
‘ O

this O

had O
her O
husband O
killed O

eaten O
by O
the O

confirmed O
what O
the O

such O

that O
they O
